You are a multimodal affective computing expert grounded in theory of mind. Your task is to decide whether the statement is sarcastic by modeling the speaker’s nonliteral intent toward an audience using causal and second-order reasoning. Proceed as follows: (1) Decode Literal Proposition & Affective Cues (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically parse lexical content together with delivery cues—prosody if available (pitch/energy/tempo/emphasis) and visual behavior if available (face/gaze/gesture). State the literal proposition and its surface polarity as outward evidence of an initial stance. (2) Model Speaker Intent & Audience Uptake (Second-Order Perspective-Taking): From the speaker→audience perspective, infer whether the speaker intends the audience to recover a meaning that contrasts with the literal stance, based only on contextual evidence in the clip (preceding events, shared situational facts shown, discourse expectations). Do not import external facts. (3) Incongruity–Reversal Test (Causal Attribution): Check for a deliberate, coherent mismatch between (a) the literal words and (b) the situational appraisal signaled by context or by prosodic/visual cues. Determine whether this mismatch supports a stable opposite interpretation (i.e., the speaker means the reverse attitude) rather than mere ambiguity or general humor. (4) Decision Rule: If the evidence indicates an intended opposite attitude that a reasonable audience would recognize (nonliteral reversal with supportive contextual/delivery cues), label as sarcastic = true; otherwise label false. (5) Conclude and Output: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then output exactly one token: true or false."

(2) Model Speaker Intent & Audience Uptake (Second-Order Perspective-Taking): From the speaker→audience perspective, infer whether the speaker intends the audience to recover a meaning that contrasts with the literal stance, based only on contextual evidence in the clip (preceding events, shared situational facts shown, discourse expectations). Do not import external facts. (3) Incongruity–Reversal Test (Causal Attribution): Check for a deliberate, coherent mismatch between (a) the literal words and (b) the situational appraisal signaled by context or by prosodic/visual cues. Determine whether this mismatch supports a stable opposite interpretation (i.e., the speaker means the reverse attitude) rather than mere ambiguity or general humor. (4) Decision Rule: If the evidence indicates an intended opposite attitude that a reasonable audience would recognize (nonliteral reversal with supportive contextual/delivery cues), label as sarcastic = true; otherwise label false. (5) Conclude and Output: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then output exactly one token: true or false."

Your task is to decide whether the statement is sarcastic by modeling the speaker’s nonliteral intent toward an audience using causal and second-order reasoning. Proceed as follows: (1) Decode Literal Proposition & Affective Cues (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically parse lexical content together with delivery cues—prosody if available (pitch/energy/tempo/emphasis) and visual behavior if available (face/gaze/gesture). State the literal proposition and its surface polarity as outward evidence of an initial stance. (2) Model Speaker Intent & Audience Uptake (Second-Order Perspective-Taking): From the speaker→audience perspective, infer whether the speaker intends the audience to recover a meaning that contrasts with the literal stance, based only on contextual evidence in the clip (preceding events, shared situational facts shown, discourse expectations). Do not import external facts. (3) Incongruity–Reversal Test (Causal Attribution): Check for a deliberate, coherent mismatch between (a) the literal words and (b) the situational appraisal signaled by context or by prosodic/visual cues. Determine whether this mismatch supports a stable opposite interpretation (i.e., the speaker means the reverse attitude) rather than mere ambiguity or general humor. (4) Decision Rule: If the evidence indicates an intended opposite attitude that a reasonable audience would recognize (nonliteral reversal with supportive contextual/delivery cues), label as sarcastic = true; otherwise label false. (5) Conclude and Output: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then output exactly one token: true or false."

Proceed as follows: (1) Decode Literal Proposition & Affective Cues (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically parse lexical content together with delivery cues—prosody if available (pitch/energy/tempo/emphasis) and visual behavior if available (face/gaze/gesture). State the literal proposition and its surface polarity as outward evidence of an initial stance. (2) Model Speaker Intent & Audience Uptake (Second-Order Perspective-Taking): From the speaker→audience perspective, infer whether the speaker intends the audience to recover a meaning that contrasts with the literal stance, based only on contextual evidence in the clip (preceding events, shared situational facts shown, discourse expectations). Do not import external facts. (3) Incongruity–Reversal Test (Causal Attribution): Check for a deliberate, coherent mismatch between (a) the literal words and (b) the situational appraisal signaled by context or by prosodic/visual cues. Determine whether this mismatch supports a stable opposite interpretation (i.e., the speaker means the reverse attitude) rather than mere ambiguity or general humor. (4) Decision Rule: If the evidence indicates an intended opposite attitude that a reasonable audience would recognize (nonliteral reversal with supportive contextual/delivery cues), label as sarcastic = true; otherwise label false. (5) Conclude and Output: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then output exactly one token: true or false."

Your task is to decide whether the statement is sarcastic by modeling the speaker’s nonliteral intent toward an audience using causal and second-order reasoning. Proceed as follows: (1) Decode Literal Proposition & Affective Cues (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically parse lexical content together with delivery cues—prosody if available (pitch/energy/tempo/emphasis) and visual behavior if available (face/gaze/gesture). State the literal proposition and its surface polarity as outward evidence of an initial stance. (2) Model Speaker Intent & Audience Uptake (Second-Order Perspective-Taking): From the speaker→audience perspective, infer whether the speaker intends the audience to recover a meaning that contrasts with the literal stance, based only on contextual evidence in the clip (preceding events, shared situational facts shown, discourse expectations). Do not import external facts. (3) Incongruity–Reversal Test (Causal Attribution): Check for a deliberate, coherent mismatch between (a) the literal words and (b) the situational appraisal signaled by context or by prosodic/visual cues. Determine whether this mismatch supports a stable opposite interpretation (i.e., the speaker means the reverse attitude) rather than mere ambiguity or general humor. (4) Decision Rule: If the evidence indicates an intended opposite attitude that a reasonable audience would recognize (nonliteral reversal with supportive contextual/delivery cues), label as sarcastic = true; otherwise label false. (5) Conclude and Output: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then output exactly one token: true or false."

You are a multimodal affective computing expert grounded in theory of mind. Your task is to decide whether the statement is sarcastic by modeling the speaker’s nonliteral intent toward an audience using causal and second-order reasoning. Proceed as follows: (1) Decode Literal Proposition & Affective Cues (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically parse lexical content together with delivery cues—prosody if available (pitch/energy/tempo/emphasis) and visual behavior if available (face/gaze/gesture). State the literal proposition and its surface polarity as outward evidence of an initial stance. (2) Model Speaker Intent & Audience Uptake (Second-Order Perspective-Taking): From the speaker→audience perspective, infer whether the speaker intends the audience to recover a meaning that contrasts with the literal stance, based only on contextual evidence in the clip (preceding events, shared situational facts shown, discourse expectations). Do not import external facts. (3) Incongruity–Reversal Test (Causal Attribution): Check for a deliberate, coherent mismatch between (a) the literal words and (b) the situational appraisal signaled by context or by prosodic/visual cues. Determine whether this mismatch supports a stable opposite interpretation (i.e., the speaker means the reverse attitude) rather than mere ambiguity or general humor. (4) Decision Rule: If the evidence indicates an intended opposite attitude that a reasonable audience would recognize (nonliteral reversal with supportive contextual/delivery cues), label as sarcastic = true; otherwise label false. (5) Conclude and Output: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then output exactly one token: true or false."

(2) Model Speaker Intent & Audience Uptake (Second-Order Perspective-Taking): From the speaker→audience perspective, infer whether the speaker intends the audience to recover a meaning that contrasts with the literal stance, based only on contextual evidence in the clip (preceding events, shared situational facts shown, discourse expectations). Do not import external facts. (3) Incongruity–Reversal Test (Causal Attribution): Check for a deliberate, coherent mismatch between (a) the literal words and (b) the situational appraisal signaled by context or by prosodic/visual cues. Determine whether this mismatch supports a stable opposite interpretation (i.e., the speaker means the reverse attitude) rather than mere ambiguity or general humor. (4) Decision Rule: If the evidence indicates an intended opposite attitude that a reasonable audience would recognize (nonliteral reversal with supportive contextual/delivery cues), label as sarcastic = true; otherwise label false. (5) Conclude and Output: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then output exactly one token: true or false."

Your task is to decide whether the statement is sarcastic by modeling the speaker’s nonliteral intent toward an audience using causal and second-order reasoning. Proceed as follows: (1) Decode Literal Proposition & Affective Cues (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically parse lexical content together with delivery cues—prosody if available (pitch/energy/tempo/emphasis) and visual behavior if available (face/gaze/gesture). State the literal proposition and its surface polarity as outward evidence of an initial stance. (2) Model Speaker Intent & Audience Uptake (Second-Order Perspective-Taking): From the speaker→audience perspective, infer whether the speaker intends the audience to recover a meaning that contrasts with the literal stance, based only on contextual evidence in the clip (preceding events, shared situational facts shown, discourse expectations). Do not import external facts. (3) Incongruity–Reversal Test (Causal Attribution): Check for a deliberate, coherent mismatch between (a) the literal words and (b) the situational appraisal signaled by context or by prosodic/visual cues. Determine whether this mismatch supports a stable opposite interpretation (i.e., the speaker means the reverse attitude) rather than mere ambiguity or general humor. (4) Decision Rule: If the evidence indicates an intended opposite attitude that a reasonable audience would recognize (nonliteral reversal with supportive contextual/delivery cues), label as sarcastic = true; otherwise label false. (5) Conclude and Output: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then output exactly one token: true or false."

Proceed as follows: (1) Decode Literal Proposition & Affective Cues (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically parse lexical content together with delivery cues—prosody if available (pitch/energy/tempo/emphasis) and visual behavior if available (face/gaze/gesture). State the literal proposition and its surface polarity as outward evidence of an initial stance. (2) Model Speaker Intent & Audience Uptake (Second-Order Perspective-Taking): From the speaker→audience perspective, infer whether the speaker intends the audience to recover a meaning that contrasts with the literal stance, based only on contextual evidence in the clip (preceding events, shared situational facts shown, discourse expectations). Do not import external facts. (3) Incongruity–Reversal Test (Causal Attribution): Check for a deliberate, coherent mismatch between (a) the literal words and (b) the situational appraisal signaled by context or by prosodic/visual cues. Determine whether this mismatch supports a stable opposite interpretation (i.e., the speaker means the reverse attitude) rather than mere ambiguity or general humor. (4) Decision Rule: If the evidence indicates an intended opposite attitude that a reasonable audience would recognize (nonliteral reversal with supportive contextual/delivery cues), label as sarcastic = true; otherwise label false. (5) Conclude and Output: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then output exactly one token: true or false."

Proceed as follows: (1) Decode Literal Proposition & Affective Cues (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically parse lexical content together with delivery cues—prosody if available (pitch/energy/tempo/emphasis) and visual behavior if available (face/gaze/gesture). State the literal proposition and its surface polarity as outward evidence of an initial stance. (2) Model Speaker Intent & Audience Uptake (Second-Order Perspective-Taking): From the speaker→audience perspective, infer whether the speaker intends the audience to recover a meaning that contrasts with the literal stance, based only on contextual evidence in the clip (preceding events, shared situational facts shown, discourse expectations). Do not import external facts. (3) Incongruity–Reversal Test (Causal Attribution): Check for a deliberate, coherent mismatch between (a) the literal words and (b) the situational appraisal signaled by context or by prosodic/visual cues. Determine whether this mismatch supports a stable opposite interpretation (i.e., the speaker means the reverse attitude) rather than mere ambiguity or general humor. (4) Decision Rule: If the evidence indicates an intended opposite attitude that a reasonable audience would recognize (nonliteral reversal with supportive contextual/delivery cues), label as sarcastic = true; otherwise label false. (5) Conclude and Output: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then output exactly one token: true or false."

You are a multimodal affective computing expert grounded in theory of mind. Your task is to decide whether the statement is sarcastic by modeling the speaker’s nonliteral intent toward an audience using causal and second-order reasoning. Proceed as follows: (1) Decode Literal Proposition & Affective Cues (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically parse lexical content together with delivery cues—prosody if available (pitch/energy/tempo/emphasis) and visual behavior if available (face/gaze/gesture). State the literal proposition and its surface polarity as outward evidence of an initial stance. (2) Model Speaker Intent & Audience Uptake (Second-Order Perspective-Taking): From the speaker→audience perspective, infer whether the speaker intends the audience to recover a meaning that contrasts with the literal stance, based only on contextual evidence in the clip (preceding events, shared situational facts shown, discourse expectations). Do not import external facts. (3) Incongruity–Reversal Test (Causal Attribution): Check for a deliberate, coherent mismatch between (a) the literal words and (b) the situational appraisal signaled by context or by prosodic/visual cues. Determine whether this mismatch supports a stable opposite interpretation (i.e., the speaker means the reverse attitude) rather than mere ambiguity or general humor. (4) Decision Rule: If the evidence indicates an intended opposite attitude that a reasonable audience would recognize (nonliteral reversal with supportive contextual/delivery cues), label as sarcastic = true; otherwise label false. (5) Conclude and Output: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then output exactly one token: true or false."

(2) Model Speaker Intent & Audience Uptake (Second-Order Perspective-Taking): From the speaker→audience perspective, infer whether the speaker intends the audience to recover a meaning that contrasts with the literal stance, based only on contextual evidence in the clip (preceding events, shared situational facts shown, discourse expectations). Do not import external facts. (3) Incongruity–Reversal Test (Causal Attribution): Check for a deliberate, coherent mismatch between (a) the literal words and (b) the situational appraisal signaled by context or by prosodic/visual cues. Determine whether this mismatch supports a stable opposite interpretation (i.e., the speaker means the reverse attitude) rather than mere ambiguity or general humor. (4) Decision Rule: If the evidence indicates an intended opposite attitude that a reasonable audience would recognize (nonliteral reversal with supportive contextual/delivery cues), label as sarcastic = true; otherwise label false. (5) Conclude and Output: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then output exactly one token: true or false."

You are a multimodal affective computing expert grounded in theory of mind. Your task is to decide whether the statement is sarcastic by modeling the speaker’s nonliteral intent toward an audience using causal and second-order reasoning. Proceed as follows: (1) Decode Literal Proposition & Affective Cues (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically parse lexical content together with delivery cues—prosody if available (pitch/energy/tempo/emphasis) and visual behavior if available (face/gaze/gesture). State the literal proposition and its surface polarity as outward evidence of an initial stance. (2) Model Speaker Intent & Audience Uptake (Second-Order Perspective-Taking): From the speaker→audience perspective, infer whether the speaker intends the audience to recover a meaning that contrasts with the literal stance, based only on contextual evidence in the clip (preceding events, shared situational facts shown, discourse expectations). Do not import external facts. (3) Incongruity–Reversal Test (Causal Attribution): Check for a deliberate, coherent mismatch between (a) the literal words and (b) the situational appraisal signaled by context or by prosodic/visual cues. Determine whether this mismatch supports a stable opposite interpretation (i.e., the speaker means the reverse attitude) rather than mere ambiguity or general humor. (4) Decision Rule: If the evidence indicates an intended opposite attitude that a reasonable audience would recognize (nonliteral reversal with supportive contextual/delivery cues), label as sarcastic = true; otherwise label false. (5) Conclude and Output: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then output exactly one token: true or false."

You are a multimodal affective computing expert grounded in theory of mind. Your task is to decide whether the statement is sarcastic by modeling the speaker’s nonliteral intent toward an audience using causal and second-order reasoning. Proceed as follows: (1) Decode Literal Proposition & Affective Cues (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically parse lexical content together with delivery cues—prosody if available (pitch/energy/tempo/emphasis) and visual behavior if available (face/gaze/gesture). State the literal proposition and its surface polarity as outward evidence of an initial stance. (2) Model Speaker Intent & Audience Uptake (Second-Order Perspective-Taking): From the speaker→audience perspective, infer whether the speaker intends the audience to recover a meaning that contrasts with the literal stance, based only on contextual evidence in the clip (preceding events, shared situational facts shown, discourse expectations). Do not import external facts. (3) Incongruity–Reversal Test (Causal Attribution): Check for a deliberate, coherent mismatch between (a) the literal words and (b) the situational appraisal signaled by context or by prosodic/visual cues. Determine whether this mismatch supports a stable opposite interpretation (i.e., the speaker means the reverse attitude) rather than mere ambiguity or general humor. (4) Decision Rule: If the evidence indicates an intended opposite attitude that a reasonable audience would recognize (nonliteral reversal with supportive contextual/delivery cues), label as sarcastic = true; otherwise label false. (5) Conclude and Output: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then output exactly one token: true or false."

Your task is to decide whether the statement is sarcastic by modeling the speaker’s nonliteral intent toward an audience using causal and second-order reasoning. Proceed as follows: (1) Decode Literal Proposition & Affective Cues (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically parse lexical content together with delivery cues—prosody if available (pitch/energy/tempo/emphasis) and visual behavior if available (face/gaze/gesture). State the literal proposition and its surface polarity as outward evidence of an initial stance. (2) Model Speaker Intent & Audience Uptake (Second-Order Perspective-Taking): From the speaker→audience perspective, infer whether the speaker intends the audience to recover a meaning that contrasts with the literal stance, based only on contextual evidence in the clip (preceding events, shared situational facts shown, discourse expectations). Do not import external facts. (3) Incongruity–Reversal Test (Causal Attribution): Check for a deliberate, coherent mismatch between (a) the literal words and (b) the situational appraisal signaled by context or by prosodic/visual cues. Determine whether this mismatch supports a stable opposite interpretation (i.e., the speaker means the reverse attitude) rather than mere ambiguity or general humor. (4) Decision Rule: If the evidence indicates an intended opposite attitude that a reasonable audience would recognize (nonliteral reversal with supportive contextual/delivery cues), label as sarcastic = true; otherwise label false. (5) Conclude and Output: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then output exactly one token: true or false."

Your task is to decide whether the statement is sarcastic by modeling the speaker’s nonliteral intent toward an audience using causal and second-order reasoning. Proceed as follows: (1) Decode Literal Proposition & Affective Cues (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically parse lexical content together with delivery cues—prosody if available (pitch/energy/tempo/emphasis) and visual behavior if available (face/gaze/gesture). State the literal proposition and its surface polarity as outward evidence of an initial stance. (2) Model Speaker Intent & Audience Uptake (Second-Order Perspective-Taking): From the speaker→audience perspective, infer whether the speaker intends the audience to recover a meaning that contrasts with the literal stance, based only on contextual evidence in the clip (preceding events, shared situational facts shown, discourse expectations). Do not import external facts. (3) Incongruity–Reversal Test (Causal Attribution): Check for a deliberate, coherent mismatch between (a) the literal words and (b) the situational appraisal signaled by context or by prosodic/visual cues. Determine whether this mismatch supports a stable opposite interpretation (i.e., the speaker means the reverse attitude) rather than mere ambiguity or general humor. (4) Decision Rule: If the evidence indicates an intended opposite attitude that a reasonable audience would recognize (nonliteral reversal with supportive contextual/delivery cues), label as sarcastic = true; otherwise label false. (5) Conclude and Output: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then output exactly one token: true or false."

You are a multimodal affective computing expert grounded in theory of mind. Your task is to decide whether the statement is sarcastic by modeling the speaker’s nonliteral intent toward an audience using causal and second-order reasoning. Proceed as follows: (1) Decode Literal Proposition & Affective Cues (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically parse lexical content together with delivery cues—prosody if available (pitch/energy/tempo/emphasis) and visual behavior if available (face/gaze/gesture). State the literal proposition and its surface polarity as outward evidence of an initial stance. (2) Model Speaker Intent & Audience Uptake (Second-Order Perspective-Taking): From the speaker→audience perspective, infer whether the speaker intends the audience to recover a meaning that contrasts with the literal stance, based only on contextual evidence in the clip (preceding events, shared situational facts shown, discourse expectations). Do not import external facts. (3) Incongruity–Reversal Test (Causal Attribution): Check for a deliberate, coherent mismatch between (a) the literal words and (b) the situational appraisal signaled by context or by prosodic/visual cues. Determine whether this mismatch supports a stable opposite interpretation (i.e., the speaker means the reverse attitude) rather than mere ambiguity or general humor. (4) Decision Rule: If the evidence indicates an intended opposite attitude that a reasonable audience would recognize (nonliteral reversal with supportive contextual/delivery cues), label as sarcastic = true; otherwise label false. (5) Conclude and Output: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then output exactly one token: true or false."

(3) Incongruity–Reversal Test (Causal Attribution): Check for a deliberate, coherent mismatch between (a) the literal words and (b) the situational appraisal signaled by context or by prosodic/visual cues. Determine whether this mismatch supports a stable opposite interpretation (i.e., the speaker means the reverse attitude) rather than mere ambiguity or general humor.

You are a multimodal affective computing expert grounded in theory of mind. Your task is to decide whether the statement is sarcastic by modeling the speaker’s nonliteral intent toward an audience using causal and second-order reasoning. Proceed as follows: (1) Decode Literal Proposition & Affective Cues (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically parse lexical content together with delivery cues—prosody if available (pitch/energy/tempo/emphasis) and visual behavior if available (face/gaze/gesture). State the literal proposition and its surface polarity as outward evidence of an initial stance. (2) Model Speaker Intent & Audience Uptake (Second-Order Perspective-Taking): From the speaker→audience perspective, infer whether the speaker intends the audience to recover a meaning that contrasts with the literal stance, based only on contextual evidence in the clip (preceding events, shared situational facts shown, discourse expectations). Do not import external facts. (3) Incongruity–Reversal Test (Causal Attribution): Check for a deliberate, coherent mismatch between (a) the literal words and (b) the situational appraisal signaled by context or by prosodic/visual cues. Determine whether this mismatch supports a stable opposite interpretation (i.e., the speaker means the reverse attitude) rather than mere ambiguity or general humor. (4) Decision Rule: If the evidence indicates an intended opposite attitude that a reasonable audience would recognize (nonliteral reversal with supportive contextual/delivery cues), label as sarcastic = true; otherwise label false. (5) Conclude and Output: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then output exactly one token: true or false."

Your task is to decide whether the statement is sarcastic by modeling the speaker’s nonliteral intent toward an audience using causal and second-order reasoning.

State the literal proposition and its surface polarity as outward evidence of an initial stance. (2) Model Speaker Intent & Audience Uptake (Second-Order Perspective-Taking): From the speaker→audience perspective, infer whether the speaker intends the audience to recover a meaning that contrasts with the literal stance, based only on contextual evidence in the clip (preceding events, shared situational facts shown, discourse expectations). Do not import external facts. (3) Incongruity–Reversal Test (Causal Attribution): Check for a deliberate, coherent mismatch between (a) the literal words and (b) the situational appraisal signaled by context or by prosodic/visual cues. Determine whether this mismatch supports a stable opposite interpretation (i.e., the speaker means the reverse attitude) rather than mere ambiguity or general humor.

Proceed as follows: (1) Decode Literal Proposition & Affective Cues (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically parse lexical content together with delivery cues—prosody if available (pitch/energy/tempo/emphasis) and visual behavior if available (face/gaze/gesture). State the literal proposition and its surface polarity as outward evidence of an initial stance. (2) Model Speaker Intent & Audience Uptake (Second-Order Perspective-Taking): From the speaker→audience perspective, infer whether the speaker intends the audience to recover a meaning that contrasts with the literal stance, based only on contextual evidence in the clip (preceding events, shared situational facts shown, discourse expectations). Do not import external facts. (3) Incongruity–Reversal Test (Causal Attribution): Check for a deliberate, coherent mismatch between (a) the literal words and (b) the situational appraisal signaled by context or by prosodic/visual cues. Determine whether this mismatch supports a stable opposite interpretation (i.e., the speaker means the reverse attitude) rather than mere ambiguity or general humor. (4) Decision Rule: If the evidence indicates an intended opposite attitude that a reasonable audience would recognize (nonliteral reversal with supportive contextual/delivery cues), label as sarcastic = true; otherwise label false. (5) Conclude and Output: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then output exactly one token: true or false."

Your task is to decide whether the statement is sarcastic by modeling the speaker’s nonliteral intent toward an audience using causal and second-order reasoning. Proceed as follows: (1) Decode Literal Proposition & Affective Cues (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically parse lexical content together with delivery cues—prosody if available (pitch/energy/tempo/emphasis) and visual behavior if available (face/gaze/gesture). State the literal proposition and its surface polarity as outward evidence of an initial stance. (2) Model Speaker Intent & Audience Uptake (Second-Order Perspective-Taking): From the speaker→audience perspective, infer whether the speaker intends the audience to recover a meaning that contrasts with the literal stance, based only on contextual evidence in the clip (preceding events, shared situational facts shown, discourse expectations). Do not import external facts. (3) Incongruity–Reversal Test (Causal Attribution): Check for a deliberate, coherent mismatch between (a) the literal words and (b) the situational appraisal signaled by context or by prosodic/visual cues. Determine whether this mismatch supports a stable opposite interpretation (i.e., the speaker means the reverse attitude) rather than mere ambiguity or general humor.

Proceed as follows: (1) Decode Literal Proposition & Affective Cues (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically parse lexical content together with delivery cues—prosody if available (pitch/energy/tempo/emphasis) and visual behavior if available (face/gaze/gesture). State the literal proposition and its surface polarity as outward evidence of an initial stance. (2) Model Speaker Intent & Audience Uptake (Second-Order Perspective-Taking): From the speaker→audience perspective, infer whether the speaker intends the audience to recover a meaning that contrasts with the literal stance, based only on contextual evidence in the clip (preceding events, shared situational facts shown, discourse expectations). Do not import external facts. (3) Incongruity–Reversal Test (Causal Attribution): Check for a deliberate, coherent mismatch between (a) the literal words and (b) the situational appraisal signaled by context or by prosodic/visual cues. Determine whether this mismatch supports a stable opposite interpretation (i.e., the speaker means the reverse attitude) rather than mere ambiguity or general humor. (4) Decision Rule: If the evidence indicates an intended opposite attitude that a reasonable audience would recognize (nonliteral reversal with supportive contextual/delivery cues), label as sarcastic = true; otherwise label false. (5) Conclude and Output: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then output exactly one token: true or false."

Your task is to decide whether the statement is sarcastic by modeling the speaker’s nonliteral intent toward an audience using causal and second-order reasoning. Proceed as follows: (1) Decode Literal Proposition & Affective Cues (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically parse lexical content together with delivery cues—prosody if available (pitch/energy/tempo/emphasis) and visual behavior if available (face/gaze/gesture). State the literal proposition and its surface polarity as outward evidence of an initial stance. (2) Model Speaker Intent & Audience Uptake (Second-Order Perspective-Taking): From the speaker→audience perspective, infer whether the speaker intends the audience to recover a meaning that contrasts with the literal stance, based only on contextual evidence in the clip (preceding events, shared situational facts shown, discourse expectations). Do not import external facts. (3) Incongruity–Reversal Test (Causal Attribution): Check for a deliberate, coherent mismatch between (a) the literal words and (b) the situational appraisal signaled by context or by prosodic/visual cues. Determine whether this mismatch supports a stable opposite interpretation (i.e., the speaker means the reverse attitude) rather than mere ambiguity or general humor.

(3) Incongruity–Reversal Test (Causal Attribution): Check for a deliberate, coherent mismatch between (a) the literal words and (b) the situational appraisal signaled by context or by prosodic/visual cues.

Your task is to decide whether the statement is sarcastic by modeling the speaker’s nonliteral intent toward an audience using causal and second-order reasoning. Proceed as follows: (1) Decode Literal Proposition & Affective Cues (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically parse lexical content together with delivery cues—prosody if available (pitch/energy/tempo/emphasis) and visual behavior if available (face/gaze/gesture). State the literal proposition and its surface polarity as outward evidence of an initial stance. (2) Model Speaker Intent & Audience Uptake (Second-Order Perspective-Taking): From the speaker→audience perspective, infer whether the speaker intends the audience to recover a meaning that contrasts with the literal stance, based only on contextual evidence in the clip (preceding events, shared situational facts shown, discourse expectations). Do not import external facts. (3) Incongruity–Reversal Test (Causal Attribution): Check for a deliberate, coherent mismatch between (a) the literal words and (b) the situational appraisal signaled by context or by prosodic/visual cues. Determine whether this mismatch supports a stable opposite interpretation (i.e., the speaker means the reverse attitude) rather than mere ambiguity or general humor. (4) Decision Rule: If the evidence indicates an intended opposite attitude that a reasonable audience would recognize (nonliteral reversal with supportive contextual/delivery cues), label as sarcastic = true; otherwise label false. (5) Conclude and Output: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then output exactly one token: true or false."

Your task is to decide whether the statement is sarcastic by modeling the speaker’s nonliteral intent toward an audience using causal and second-order reasoning. Proceed as follows: (1) Decode Literal Proposition & Affective Cues (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically parse lexical content together with delivery cues—prosody if available (pitch/energy/tempo/emphasis) and visual behavior if available (face/gaze/gesture). State the literal proposition and its surface polarity as outward evidence of an initial stance. (2) Model Speaker Intent & Audience Uptake (Second-Order Perspective-Taking): From the speaker→audience perspective, infer whether the speaker intends the audience to recover a meaning that contrasts with the literal stance, based only on contextual evidence in the clip (preceding events, shared situational facts shown, discourse expectations). Do not import external facts. (3) Incongruity–Reversal Test (Causal Attribution): Check for a deliberate, coherent mismatch between (a) the literal words and (b) the situational appraisal signaled by context or by prosodic/visual cues. Determine whether this mismatch supports a stable opposite interpretation (i.e., the speaker means the reverse attitude) rather than mere ambiguity or general humor. (4) Decision Rule: If the evidence indicates an intended opposite attitude that a reasonable audience would recognize (nonliteral reversal with supportive contextual/delivery cues), label as sarcastic = true; otherwise label false. (5) Conclude and Output: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then output exactly one token: true or false."

(2) Model Speaker Intent & Audience Uptake (Second-Order Perspective-Taking): From the speaker→audience perspective, infer whether the speaker intends the audience to recover a meaning that contrasts with the literal stance, based only on contextual evidence in the clip (preceding events, shared situational facts shown, discourse expectations). Do not import external facts. (3) Incongruity–Reversal Test (Causal Attribution): Check for a deliberate, coherent mismatch between (a) the literal words and (b) the situational appraisal signaled by context or by prosodic/visual cues. Determine whether this mismatch supports a stable opposite interpretation (i.e., the speaker means the reverse attitude) rather than mere ambiguity or general humor. (4) Decision Rule: If the evidence indicates an intended opposite attitude that a reasonable audience would recognize (nonliteral reversal with supportive contextual/delivery cues), label as sarcastic = true; otherwise label false. (5) Conclude and Output: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then output exactly one token: true or false."

You are a multimodal affective computing expert grounded in theory of mind. Your task is to decide whether the statement is sarcastic by modeling the speaker’s nonliteral intent toward an audience using causal and second-order reasoning. Proceed as follows: (1) Decode Literal Proposition & Affective Cues (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically parse lexical content together with delivery cues—prosody if available (pitch/energy/tempo/emphasis) and visual behavior if available (face/gaze/gesture). State the literal proposition and its surface polarity as outward evidence of an initial stance. (2) Model Speaker Intent & Audience Uptake (Second-Order Perspective-Taking): From the speaker→audience perspective, infer whether the speaker intends the audience to recover a meaning that contrasts with the literal stance, based only on contextual evidence in the clip (preceding events, shared situational facts shown, discourse expectations). Do not import external facts. (3) Incongruity–Reversal Test (Causal Attribution): Check for a deliberate, coherent mismatch between (a) the literal words and (b) the situational appraisal signaled by context or by prosodic/visual cues. Determine whether this mismatch supports a stable opposite interpretation (i.e., the speaker means the reverse attitude) rather than mere ambiguity or general humor. (4) Decision Rule: If the evidence indicates an intended opposite attitude that a reasonable audience would recognize (nonliteral reversal with supportive contextual/delivery cues), label as sarcastic = true; otherwise label false. (5) Conclude and Output: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then output exactly one token: true or false."
