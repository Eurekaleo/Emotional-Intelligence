Summarize the baseline interpretation established by the setup.

Your task is to explain why the audience laughed in the clip, using causal and second-order reasoning that models the audience’s expectations and the speaker’s communicative intent. Proceed as follows: (1) Decode Setup & Delivery Cues (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically parse the setup content and the punchline region together with delivery cues—lexical propositions, prosody/timing (pauses, pitch/energy shifts), facial/gestural markers, and any on-screen audience reactions. Summarize the baseline interpretation established by the setup. (2) Model Audience Expectations (Second-Order Perspective-Taking): From a generic audience perspective, state what they are led to expect immediately before the trigger (the belief/interpretation they momentarily hold based on the setup and delivery). (3) Identify the Humor Trigger & Mechanism (Causal Attribution): Locate the specific element that violates or reinterprets the baseline (e.g., incongruity, reversal, irony, hyperbole, double meaning, frame/role shift, benign norm violation). Ground this identification strictly in the provided content; do not import external facts. (4) Explain the Causal Link & Intent (Relational Mapping): Explain how this trigger causes a quick reinterpretation that resolves surprise into amusement and signals playful intent from the speaker to the audience. Note any delivery features (timing/emphasis) that amplify the effect. (5) Conclude and Output: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then output a single sentence starting with: The audience laughed because ..."

(audience laughs)\nYou are a multimodal affective computing expert grounded in theory of mind. Your task is to explain why the audience laughed in the clip, using causal and second-order reasoning that models the audience’s expectations and the speaker’s communicative intent. Proceed as follows: (1) Decode Setup & Delivery Cues (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically parse the setup content and the punchline region together with delivery cues—lexical propositions, prosody/timing (pauses, pitch/energy shifts), facial/gestural markers, and any on-screen audience reactions. Summarize the baseline interpretation established by the setup. (2) Model Audience Expectations (Second-Order Perspective-Taking): From a generic audience perspective, state what they are led to expect immediately before the trigger (the belief/interpretation they momentarily hold based on the setup and delivery). (3) Identify the Humor Trigger & Mechanism (Causal Attribution): Locate the specific element that violates or reinterprets the baseline (e.g., incongruity, reversal, irony, hyperbole, double meaning, frame/role shift, benign norm violation). Ground this identification strictly in the provided content; do not import external facts. (4) Explain the Causal Link & Intent (Relational Mapping): Explain how this trigger causes a quick reinterpretation that resolves surprise into amusement and signals playful intent from the speaker to the audience. Note any delivery features (timing/emphasis) that amplify the effect. (5) Conclude and Output: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then output a single sentence starting with: The audience laughed because ..."
