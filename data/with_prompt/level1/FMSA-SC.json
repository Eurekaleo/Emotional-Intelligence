You are a multimodal affective computing expert grounded in theory of mind. Your task is to infer the commenter’s current first-order evaluative attitude toward the financial target with graded strength by reasoning about their mental world from multimodal evidence. Complete the stock comment emotion analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Evaluative Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner stance—lexical content (finance-laden evaluations, polarity terms, certainty/hedging and modality markers, numeric framing, comparative/superlative wording), speech prosody if available (pitch/loudness/tempo/emphasis indicating confidence or doubt), and visual behavior if available (facial expression, nods/shakes, posture/gesture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its likely polarity direction and strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Attitude Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and a strength level (weak/strong) toward the specific financial target implied in the comment. If cues converge, state that they reinforce the same graded attitude; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Commenter’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative attitude from the commenter’s perspective toward the financial target. Exclude interpretations based on the viewer’s reaction, actual market outcomes, or stable personality traits. (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: weak negative, strong negative, neutral, weak positive, strong positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Complete the stock comment emotion analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Evaluative Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner stance—lexical content (finance-laden evaluations, polarity terms, certainty/hedging and modality markers, numeric framing, comparative/superlative wording), speech prosody if available (pitch/loudness/tempo/emphasis indicating confidence or doubt), and visual behavior if available (facial expression, nods/shakes, posture/gesture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its likely polarity direction and strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Attitude Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and a strength level (weak/strong) toward the specific financial target implied in the comment. If cues converge, state that they reinforce the same graded attitude; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Commenter’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative attitude from the commenter’s perspective toward the financial target.

Complete the stock comment emotion analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Evaluative Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner stance—lexical content (finance-laden evaluations, polarity terms, certainty/hedging and modality markers, numeric framing, comparative/superlative wording), speech prosody if available (pitch/loudness/tempo/emphasis indicating confidence or doubt), and visual behavior if available (facial expression, nods/shakes, posture/gesture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its likely polarity direction and strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Attitude Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and a strength level (weak/strong) toward the specific financial target implied in the comment. If cues converge, state that they reinforce the same graded attitude; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Commenter’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative attitude from the commenter’s perspective toward the financial target. Exclude interpretations based on the viewer’s reaction, actual market outcomes, or stable personality traits. (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: weak negative, strong negative, neutral, weak positive, strong positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

You are a multimodal affective computing expert grounded in theory of mind. Your task is to infer the commenter’s current first-order evaluative attitude toward the financial target with graded strength by reasoning about their mental world from multimodal evidence. Complete the stock comment emotion analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Evaluative Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner stance—lexical content (finance-laden evaluations, polarity terms, certainty/hedging and modality markers, numeric framing, comparative/superlative wording), speech prosody if available (pitch/loudness/tempo/emphasis indicating confidence or doubt), and visual behavior if available (facial expression, nods/shakes, posture/gesture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its likely polarity direction and strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Attitude Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and a strength level (weak/strong) toward the specific financial target implied in the comment. If cues converge, state that they reinforce the same graded attitude; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Commenter’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative attitude from the commenter’s perspective toward the financial target. Exclude interpretations based on the viewer’s reaction, actual market outcomes, or stable personality traits. (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: weak negative, strong negative, neutral, weak positive, strong positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Complete the stock comment emotion analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Evaluative Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner stance—lexical content (finance-laden evaluations, polarity terms, certainty/hedging and modality markers, numeric framing, comparative/superlative wording), speech prosody if available (pitch/loudness/tempo/emphasis indicating confidence or doubt), and visual behavior if available (facial expression, nods/shakes, posture/gesture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its likely polarity direction and strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Attitude Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and a strength level (weak/strong) toward the specific financial target implied in the comment. If cues converge, state that they reinforce the same graded attitude; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Commenter’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative attitude from the commenter’s perspective toward the financial target. Exclude interpretations based on the viewer’s reaction, actual market outcomes, or stable personality traits. (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: weak negative, strong negative, neutral, weak positive, strong positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

You are a multimodal affective computing expert grounded in theory of mind. Your task is to infer the commenter’s current first-order evaluative attitude toward the financial target with graded strength by reasoning about their mental world from multimodal evidence. Complete the stock comment emotion analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Evaluative Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner stance—lexical content (finance-laden evaluations, polarity terms, certainty/hedging and modality markers, numeric framing, comparative/superlative wording), speech prosody if available (pitch/loudness/tempo/emphasis indicating confidence or doubt), and visual behavior if available (facial expression, nods/shakes, posture/gesture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its likely polarity direction and strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Attitude Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and a strength level (weak/strong) toward the specific financial target implied in the comment. If cues converge, state that they reinforce the same graded attitude; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Commenter’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative attitude from the commenter’s perspective toward the financial target. Exclude interpretations based on the viewer’s reaction, actual market outcomes, or stable personality traits. (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: weak negative, strong negative, neutral, weak positive, strong positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Your task is to infer the commenter’s current first-order evaluative attitude toward the financial target with graded strength by reasoning about their mental world from multimodal evidence. Complete the stock comment emotion analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Evaluative Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner stance—lexical content (finance-laden evaluations, polarity terms, certainty/hedging and modality markers, numeric framing, comparative/superlative wording), speech prosody if available (pitch/loudness/tempo/emphasis indicating confidence or doubt), and visual behavior if available (facial expression, nods/shakes, posture/gesture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its likely polarity direction and strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Attitude Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and a strength level (weak/strong) toward the specific financial target implied in the comment. If cues converge, state that they reinforce the same graded attitude; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Commenter’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative attitude from the commenter’s perspective toward the financial target.

Your task is to infer the commenter’s current first-order evaluative attitude toward the financial target with graded strength by reasoning about their mental world from multimodal evidence. Complete the stock comment emotion analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Evaluative Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner stance—lexical content (finance-laden evaluations, polarity terms, certainty/hedging and modality markers, numeric framing, comparative/superlative wording), speech prosody if available (pitch/loudness/tempo/emphasis indicating confidence or doubt), and visual behavior if available (facial expression, nods/shakes, posture/gesture tension).

Your task is to infer the commenter’s current first-order evaluative attitude toward the financial target with graded strength by reasoning about their mental world from multimodal evidence. Complete the stock comment emotion analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Evaluative Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner stance—lexical content (finance-laden evaluations, polarity terms, certainty/hedging and modality markers, numeric framing, comparative/superlative wording), speech prosody if available (pitch/loudness/tempo/emphasis indicating confidence or doubt), and visual behavior if available (facial expression, nods/shakes, posture/gesture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its likely polarity direction and strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Attitude Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and a strength level (weak/strong) toward the specific financial target implied in the comment. If cues converge, state that they reinforce the same graded attitude; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes.

(2) Synthesize a Graded Attitude Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and a strength level (weak/strong) toward the specific financial target implied in the comment. If cues converge, state that they reinforce the same graded attitude; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Commenter’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative attitude from the commenter’s perspective toward the financial target. Exclude interpretations based on the viewer’s reaction, actual market outcomes, or stable personality traits. (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: weak negative, strong negative, neutral, weak positive, strong positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Your task is to infer the commenter’s current first-order evaluative attitude toward the financial target with graded strength by reasoning about their mental world from multimodal evidence. Complete the stock comment emotion analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Evaluative Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner stance—lexical content (finance-laden evaluations, polarity terms, certainty/hedging and modality markers, numeric framing, comparative/superlative wording), speech prosody if available (pitch/loudness/tempo/emphasis indicating confidence or doubt), and visual behavior if available (facial expression, nods/shakes, posture/gesture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its likely polarity direction and strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Attitude Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and a strength level (weak/strong) toward the specific financial target implied in the comment. If cues converge, state that they reinforce the same graded attitude; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Commenter’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative attitude from the commenter’s perspective toward the financial target.

(2) Synthesize a Graded Attitude Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and a strength level (weak/strong) toward the specific financial target implied in the comment. If cues converge, state that they reinforce the same graded attitude; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Commenter’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative attitude from the commenter’s perspective toward the financial target. Exclude interpretations based on the viewer’s reaction, actual market outcomes, or stable personality traits. (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: weak negative, strong negative, neutral, weak positive, strong positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Your task is to infer the commenter’s current first-order evaluative attitude toward the financial target with graded strength by reasoning about their mental world from multimodal evidence. Complete the stock comment emotion analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Evaluative Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner stance—lexical content (finance-laden evaluations, polarity terms, certainty/hedging and modality markers, numeric framing, comparative/superlative wording), speech prosody if available (pitch/loudness/tempo/emphasis indicating confidence or doubt), and visual behavior if available (facial expression, nods/shakes, posture/gesture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its likely polarity direction and strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Attitude Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and a strength level (weak/strong) toward the specific financial target implied in the comment. If cues converge, state that they reinforce the same graded attitude; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Commenter’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative attitude from the commenter’s perspective toward the financial target.
