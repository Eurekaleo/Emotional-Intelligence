Your task is to infer the speaker’s current first-order evaluative state with graded intensity by reasoning about their mental world from multimodal evidence. Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: Strong Negative, Moderate Negative, Slight Negative, Neutral, Slight Positive, Moderate Positive, Strong Positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Your task is to infer the speaker’s current first-order evaluative state with graded intensity by reasoning about their mental world from multimodal evidence. Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: Strong Negative, Moderate Negative, Slight Negative, Neutral, Slight Positive, Moderate Positive, Strong Positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Your task is to infer the speaker’s current first-order evaluative state with graded intensity by reasoning about their mental world from multimodal evidence. Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: Strong Negative, Moderate Negative, Slight Negative, Neutral, Slight Positive, Moderate Positive, Strong Positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait).

Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: Strong Negative, Moderate Negative, Slight Negative, Neutral, Slight Positive, Moderate Positive, Strong Positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Your task is to infer the speaker’s current first-order evaluative state with graded intensity by reasoning about their mental world from multimodal evidence. Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: Strong Negative, Moderate Negative, Slight Negative, Neutral, Slight Positive, Moderate Positive, Strong Positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Your task is to infer the speaker’s current first-order evaluative state with graded intensity by reasoning about their mental world from multimodal evidence. Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: Strong Negative, Moderate Negative, Slight Negative, Neutral, Slight Positive, Moderate Positive, Strong Positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: Strong Negative, Moderate Negative, Slight Negative, Neutral, Slight Positive, Moderate Positive, Strong Positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Your task is to infer the speaker’s current first-order evaluative state with graded intensity by reasoning about their mental world from multimodal evidence. Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait).

(2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes.

Your task is to infer the speaker’s current first-order evaluative state with graded intensity by reasoning about their mental world from multimodal evidence. Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: Strong Negative, Moderate Negative, Slight Negative, Neutral, Slight Positive, Moderate Positive, Strong Positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Your task is to infer the speaker’s current first-order evaluative state with graded intensity by reasoning about their mental world from multimodal evidence. Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: Strong Negative, Moderate Negative, Slight Negative, Neutral, Slight Positive, Moderate Positive, Strong Positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Your task is to infer the speaker’s current first-order evaluative state with graded intensity by reasoning about their mental world from multimodal evidence. Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: Strong Negative, Moderate Negative, Slight Negative, Neutral, Slight Positive, Moderate Positive, Strong Positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Your task is to infer the speaker’s current first-order evaluative state with graded intensity by reasoning about their mental world from multimodal evidence. Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: Strong Negative, Moderate Negative, Slight Negative, Neutral, Slight Positive, Moderate Positive, Strong Positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Your task is to infer the speaker’s current first-order evaluative state with graded intensity by reasoning about their mental world from multimodal evidence. Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: Strong Negative, Moderate Negative, Slight Negative, Neutral, Slight Positive, Moderate Positive, Strong Positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

(2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes.

(2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait).

Your task is to infer the speaker’s current first-order evaluative state with graded intensity by reasoning about their mental world from multimodal evidence. Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: Strong Negative, Moderate Negative, Slight Negative, Neutral, Slight Positive, Moderate Positive, Strong Positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Your task is to infer the speaker’s current first-order evaluative state with graded intensity by reasoning about their mental world from multimodal evidence. Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: Strong Negative, Moderate Negative, Slight Negative, Neutral, Slight Positive, Moderate Positive, Strong Positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

(2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes.

Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait).

Your task is to infer the speaker’s current first-order evaluative state with graded intensity by reasoning about their mental world from multimodal evidence. Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: Strong Negative, Moderate Negative, Slight Negative, Neutral, Slight Positive, Moderate Positive, Strong Positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension).

(2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong).

Your task is to infer the speaker’s current first-order evaluative state with graded intensity by reasoning about their mental world from multimodal evidence. Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: Strong Negative, Moderate Negative, Slight Negative, Neutral, Slight Positive, Moderate Positive, Strong Positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Your task is to infer the speaker’s current first-order evaluative state with graded intensity by reasoning about their mental world from multimodal evidence. Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: Strong Negative, Moderate Negative, Slight Negative, Neutral, Slight Positive, Moderate Positive, Strong Positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Your task is to infer the speaker’s current first-order evaluative state with graded intensity by reasoning about their mental world from multimodal evidence. Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: Strong Negative, Moderate Negative, Slight Negative, Neutral, Slight Positive, Moderate Positive, Strong Positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Your task is to infer the speaker’s current first-order evaluative state with graded intensity by reasoning about their mental world from multimodal evidence. Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: Strong Negative, Moderate Negative, Slight Negative, Neutral, Slight Positive, Moderate Positive, Strong Positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Your task is to infer the speaker’s current first-order evaluative state with graded intensity by reasoning about their mental world from multimodal evidence. Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait).

Your task is to infer the speaker’s current first-order evaluative state with graded intensity by reasoning about their mental world from multimodal evidence. Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: Strong Negative, Moderate Negative, Slight Negative, Neutral, Slight Positive, Moderate Positive, Strong Positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: Strong Negative, Moderate Negative, Slight Negative, Neutral, Slight Positive, Moderate Positive, Strong Positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: Strong Negative, Moderate Negative, Slight Negative, Neutral, Slight Positive, Moderate Positive, Strong Positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: Strong Negative, Moderate Negative, Slight Negative, Neutral, Slight Positive, Moderate Positive, Strong Positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: Strong Negative, Moderate Negative, Slight Negative, Neutral, Slight Positive, Moderate Positive, Strong Positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Your task is to infer the speaker’s current first-order evaluative state with graded intensity by reasoning about their mental world from multimodal evidence. Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: Strong Negative, Moderate Negative, Slight Negative, Neutral, Slight Positive, Moderate Positive, Strong Positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Your task is to infer the speaker’s current first-order evaluative state with graded intensity by reasoning about their mental world from multimodal evidence. Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: Strong Negative, Moderate Negative, Slight Negative, Neutral, Slight Positive, Moderate Positive, Strong Positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Your task is to infer the speaker’s current first-order evaluative state with graded intensity by reasoning about their mental world from multimodal evidence. Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: Strong Negative, Moderate Negative, Slight Negative, Neutral, Slight Positive, Moderate Positive, Strong Positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: Strong Negative, Moderate Negative, Slight Negative, Neutral, Slight Positive, Moderate Positive, Strong Positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Your task is to infer the speaker’s current first-order evaluative state with graded intensity by reasoning about their mental world from multimodal evidence. Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: Strong Negative, Moderate Negative, Slight Negative, Neutral, Slight Positive, Moderate Positive, Strong Positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: Strong Negative, Moderate Negative, Slight Negative, Neutral, Slight Positive, Moderate Positive, Strong Positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Your task is to infer the speaker’s current first-order evaluative state with graded intensity by reasoning about their mental world from multimodal evidence. Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: Strong Negative, Moderate Negative, Slight Negative, Neutral, Slight Positive, Moderate Positive, Strong Positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Your task is to infer the speaker’s current first-order evaluative state with graded intensity by reasoning about their mental world from multimodal evidence. Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: Strong Negative, Moderate Negative, Slight Negative, Neutral, Slight Positive, Moderate Positive, Strong Positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Your task is to infer the speaker’s current first-order evaluative state with graded intensity by reasoning about their mental world from multimodal evidence. Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: Strong Negative, Moderate Negative, Slight Negative, Neutral, Slight Positive, Moderate Positive, Strong Positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Your task is to infer the speaker’s current first-order evaluative state with graded intensity by reasoning about their mental world from multimodal evidence. Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes.

Your task is to infer the speaker’s current first-order evaluative state with graded intensity by reasoning about their mental world from multimodal evidence. Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: Strong Negative, Moderate Negative, Slight Negative, Neutral, Slight Positive, Moderate Positive, Strong Positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Your task is to infer the speaker’s current first-order evaluative state with graded intensity by reasoning about their mental world from multimodal evidence. Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: Strong Negative, Moderate Negative, Slight Negative, Neutral, Slight Positive, Moderate Positive, Strong Positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Your task is to infer the speaker’s current first-order evaluative state with graded intensity by reasoning about their mental world from multimodal evidence. Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: Strong Negative, Moderate Negative, Slight Negative, Neutral, Slight Positive, Moderate Positive, Strong Positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Your task is to infer the speaker’s current first-order evaluative state with graded intensity by reasoning about their mental world from multimodal evidence. Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait).

Your task is to infer the speaker’s current first-order evaluative state with graded intensity by reasoning about their mental world from multimodal evidence. Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: Strong Negative, Moderate Negative, Slight Negative, Neutral, Slight Positive, Moderate Positive, Strong Positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Your task is to infer the speaker’s current first-order evaluative state with graded intensity by reasoning about their mental world from multimodal evidence. Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: Strong Negative, Moderate Negative, Slight Negative, Neutral, Slight Positive, Moderate Positive, Strong Positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Your task is to infer the speaker’s current first-order evaluative state with graded intensity by reasoning about their mental world from multimodal evidence. Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: Strong Negative, Moderate Negative, Slight Negative, Neutral, Slight Positive, Moderate Positive, Strong Positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Your task is to infer the speaker’s current first-order evaluative state with graded intensity by reasoning about their mental world from multimodal evidence. Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: Strong Negative, Moderate Negative, Slight Negative, Neutral, Slight Positive, Moderate Positive, Strong Positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Your task is to infer the speaker’s current first-order evaluative state with graded intensity by reasoning about their mental world from multimodal evidence. Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: Strong Negative, Moderate Negative, Slight Negative, Neutral, Slight Positive, Moderate Positive, Strong Positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Your task is to infer the speaker’s current first-order evaluative state with graded intensity by reasoning about their mental world from multimodal evidence. Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: Strong Negative, Moderate Negative, Slight Negative, Neutral, Slight Positive, Moderate Positive, Strong Positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: Strong Negative, Moderate Negative, Slight Negative, Neutral, Slight Positive, Moderate Positive, Strong Positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Your task is to infer the speaker’s current first-order evaluative state with graded intensity by reasoning about their mental world from multimodal evidence. Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait).

This movie takes you through the journey of a child who learns life's lessons and it might just leave you crying in the end\nYou are a multimodal affective computing expert grounded in theory of mind. Your task is to infer the speaker’s current first-order evaluative state with graded intensity by reasoning about their mental world from multimodal evidence. Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: Strong Negative, Moderate Negative, Slight Negative, Neutral, Slight Positive, Moderate Positive, Strong Positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Your task is to infer the speaker’s current first-order evaluative state with graded intensity by reasoning about their mental world from multimodal evidence. Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: Strong Negative, Moderate Negative, Slight Negative, Neutral, Slight Positive, Moderate Positive, Strong Positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Your task is to infer the speaker’s current first-order evaluative state with graded intensity by reasoning about their mental world from multimodal evidence. Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: Strong Negative, Moderate Negative, Slight Negative, Neutral, Slight Positive, Moderate Positive, Strong Positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

(2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: Strong Negative, Moderate Negative, Slight Negative, Neutral, Slight Positive, Moderate Positive, Strong Positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: Strong Negative, Moderate Negative, Slight Negative, Neutral, Slight Positive, Moderate Positive, Strong Positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Your task is to infer the speaker’s current first-order evaluative state with graded intensity by reasoning about their mental world from multimodal evidence. Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: Strong Negative, Moderate Negative, Slight Negative, Neutral, Slight Positive, Moderate Positive, Strong Positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Your task is to infer the speaker’s current first-order evaluative state with graded intensity by reasoning about their mental world from multimodal evidence. Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: Strong Negative, Moderate Negative, Slight Negative, Neutral, Slight Positive, Moderate Positive, Strong Positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Your task is to infer the speaker’s current first-order evaluative state with graded intensity by reasoning about their mental world from multimodal evidence. Complete the sentiment intensity analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Polarity & Intensity Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode observable cues as outward evidence of an inner state—lexical content/transcript (if provided: evaluative terms, intensifiers/diminishers, negation, capitalization, repetition/elongation, emojis), speech prosody (if available: pitch, loudness/energy, tempo, emphasis), and visual behavior (facial muscle activation, gesture force, posture tension). Briefly note each present cue with its polarity direction and intensity strength. (2) Synthesize a Graded Mental State Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis consisting of a base polarity (positive/negative/neutral) and an intensity level (slight/moderate/strong). Indicate whether the cues converge; if some diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in observable evidence without inventing unobserved causes. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate evaluative state with intensity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: Strong Negative, Moderate Negative, Slight Negative, Neutral, Slight Positive, Moderate Positive, Strong Positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."
