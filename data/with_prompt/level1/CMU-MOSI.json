Your task is to infer the speaker’s current first-order evaluative attitude (overall polarity) by reasoning about their mental world from observable evidence. Complete the opinion sentiment analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Propositional & Affective Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode the spoken/ textual content to identify opinionated predicates, evaluative terms, intensifiers/negations, and modality markers (lexical content/transcript if provided). Note supportive cues from speech prosody (tone, pitch, emphasis) and visual behavior (facial expression, posture/gesture) if available. Briefly describe each present cue and its likely polarity. (2) Synthesize a Propositional Attitude Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis about the speaker’s evaluative stance toward what is being talked about. If the cues converge, state that they reinforce the same polarity. If some cues diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in the observable evidence without speculating beyond it. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate overall polarity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait).

Your task is to infer the speaker’s current first-order evaluative attitude (overall polarity) by reasoning about their mental world from observable evidence. Complete the opinion sentiment analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Propositional & Affective Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode the spoken/ textual content to identify opinionated predicates, evaluative terms, intensifiers/negations, and modality markers (lexical content/transcript if provided). Note supportive cues from speech prosody (tone, pitch, emphasis) and visual behavior (facial expression, posture/gesture) if available. Briefly describe each present cue and its likely polarity. (2) Synthesize a Propositional Attitude Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis about the speaker’s evaluative stance toward what is being talked about. If the cues converge, state that they reinforce the same polarity. If some cues diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in the observable evidence without speculating beyond it. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate overall polarity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait).

Complete the opinion sentiment analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Propositional & Affective Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode the spoken/ textual content to identify opinionated predicates, evaluative terms, intensifiers/negations, and modality markers (lexical content/transcript if provided). Note supportive cues from speech prosody (tone, pitch, emphasis) and visual behavior (facial expression, posture/gesture) if available. Briefly describe each present cue and its likely polarity. (2) Synthesize a Propositional Attitude Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis about the speaker’s evaluative stance toward what is being talked about. If the cues converge, state that they reinforce the same polarity. If some cues diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in the observable evidence without speculating beyond it. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate overall polarity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: neutral, negative, positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

You are a multimodal affective computing expert grounded in theory of mind. Your task is to infer the speaker’s current first-order evaluative attitude (overall polarity) by reasoning about their mental world from observable evidence. Complete the opinion sentiment analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Propositional & Affective Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode the spoken/ textual content to identify opinionated predicates, evaluative terms, intensifiers/negations, and modality markers (lexical content/transcript if provided). Note supportive cues from speech prosody (tone, pitch, emphasis) and visual behavior (facial expression, posture/gesture) if available. Briefly describe each present cue and its likely polarity. (2) Synthesize a Propositional Attitude Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis about the speaker’s evaluative stance toward what is being talked about. If the cues converge, state that they reinforce the same polarity. If some cues diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in the observable evidence without speculating beyond it. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate overall polarity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: neutral, negative, positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Complete the opinion sentiment analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Propositional & Affective Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode the spoken/ textual content to identify opinionated predicates, evaluative terms, intensifiers/negations, and modality markers (lexical content/transcript if provided). Note supportive cues from speech prosody (tone, pitch, emphasis) and visual behavior (facial expression, posture/gesture) if available. Briefly describe each present cue and its likely polarity. (2) Synthesize a Propositional Attitude Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis about the speaker’s evaluative stance toward what is being talked about. If the cues converge, state that they reinforce the same polarity.

Complete the opinion sentiment analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Propositional & Affective Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode the spoken/ textual content to identify opinionated predicates, evaluative terms, intensifiers/negations, and modality markers (lexical content/transcript if provided). Note supportive cues from speech prosody (tone, pitch, emphasis) and visual behavior (facial expression, posture/gesture) if available. Briefly describe each present cue and its likely polarity. (2) Synthesize a Propositional Attitude Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis about the speaker’s evaluative stance toward what is being talked about. If the cues converge, state that they reinforce the same polarity. If some cues diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in the observable evidence without speculating beyond it.

Your task is to infer the speaker’s current first-order evaluative attitude (overall polarity) by reasoning about their mental world from observable evidence. Complete the opinion sentiment analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Propositional & Affective Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode the spoken/ textual content to identify opinionated predicates, evaluative terms, intensifiers/negations, and modality markers (lexical content/transcript if provided). Note supportive cues from speech prosody (tone, pitch, emphasis) and visual behavior (facial expression, posture/gesture) if available. Briefly describe each present cue and its likely polarity. (2) Synthesize a Propositional Attitude Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis about the speaker’s evaluative stance toward what is being talked about. If the cues converge, state that they reinforce the same polarity. If some cues diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in the observable evidence without speculating beyond it. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate overall polarity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait).

Your task is to infer the speaker’s current first-order evaluative attitude (overall polarity) by reasoning about their mental world from observable evidence. Complete the opinion sentiment analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Propositional & Affective Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode the spoken/ textual content to identify opinionated predicates, evaluative terms, intensifiers/negations, and modality markers (lexical content/transcript if provided). Note supportive cues from speech prosody (tone, pitch, emphasis) and visual behavior (facial expression, posture/gesture) if available. Briefly describe each present cue and its likely polarity. (2) Synthesize a Propositional Attitude Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis about the speaker’s evaluative stance toward what is being talked about. If the cues converge, state that they reinforce the same polarity. If some cues diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in the observable evidence without speculating beyond it. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate overall polarity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait).

Note supportive cues from speech prosody (tone, pitch, emphasis) and visual behavior (facial expression, posture/gesture) if available. Briefly describe each present cue and its likely polarity. (2) Synthesize a Propositional Attitude Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis about the speaker’s evaluative stance toward what is being talked about. If the cues converge, state that they reinforce the same polarity. If some cues diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in the observable evidence without speculating beyond it. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate overall polarity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: neutral, negative, positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Complete the opinion sentiment analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Propositional & Affective Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode the spoken/ textual content to identify opinionated predicates, evaluative terms, intensifiers/negations, and modality markers (lexical content/transcript if provided). Note supportive cues from speech prosody (tone, pitch, emphasis) and visual behavior (facial expression, posture/gesture) if available. Briefly describe each present cue and its likely polarity. (2) Synthesize a Propositional Attitude Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis about the speaker’s evaluative stance toward what is being talked about. If the cues converge, state that they reinforce the same polarity. If some cues diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in the observable evidence without speculating beyond it.

Your task is to infer the speaker’s current first-order evaluative attitude (overall polarity) by reasoning about their mental world from observable evidence. Complete the opinion sentiment analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Propositional & Affective Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode the spoken/ textual content to identify opinionated predicates, evaluative terms, intensifiers/negations, and modality markers (lexical content/transcript if provided). Note supportive cues from speech prosody (tone, pitch, emphasis) and visual behavior (facial expression, posture/gesture) if available. Briefly describe each present cue and its likely polarity. (2) Synthesize a Propositional Attitude Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis about the speaker’s evaluative stance toward what is being talked about. If the cues converge, state that they reinforce the same polarity. If some cues diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in the observable evidence without speculating beyond it. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate overall polarity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait).

Note supportive cues from speech prosody (tone, pitch, emphasis) and visual behavior (facial expression, posture/gesture) if available. Briefly describe each present cue and its likely polarity.

If the cues converge, state that they reinforce the same polarity. If some cues diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in the observable evidence without speculating beyond it.

Complete the opinion sentiment analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Propositional & Affective Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode the spoken/ textual content to identify opinionated predicates, evaluative terms, intensifiers/negations, and modality markers (lexical content/transcript if provided). Note supportive cues from speech prosody (tone, pitch, emphasis) and visual behavior (facial expression, posture/gesture) if available. Briefly describe each present cue and its likely polarity. (2) Synthesize a Propositional Attitude Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis about the speaker’s evaluative stance toward what is being talked about. If the cues converge, state that they reinforce the same polarity. If some cues diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in the observable evidence without speculating beyond it.

Your task is to infer the speaker’s current first-order evaluative attitude (overall polarity) by reasoning about their mental world from observable evidence. Complete the opinion sentiment analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Propositional & Affective Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode the spoken/ textual content to identify opinionated predicates, evaluative terms, intensifiers/negations, and modality markers (lexical content/transcript if provided). Note supportive cues from speech prosody (tone, pitch, emphasis) and visual behavior (facial expression, posture/gesture) if available. Briefly describe each present cue and its likely polarity. (2) Synthesize a Propositional Attitude Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis about the speaker’s evaluative stance toward what is being talked about. If the cues converge, state that they reinforce the same polarity. If some cues diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in the observable evidence without speculating beyond it. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate overall polarity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait).

Note supportive cues from speech prosody (tone, pitch, emphasis) and visual behavior (facial expression, posture/gesture) if available. Briefly describe each present cue and its likely polarity. (2) Synthesize a Propositional Attitude Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis about the speaker’s evaluative stance toward what is being talked about. If the cues converge, state that they reinforce the same polarity. If some cues diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in the observable evidence without speculating beyond it.

Complete the opinion sentiment analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Propositional & Affective Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode the spoken/ textual content to identify opinionated predicates, evaluative terms, intensifiers/negations, and modality markers (lexical content/transcript if provided). Note supportive cues from speech prosody (tone, pitch, emphasis) and visual behavior (facial expression, posture/gesture) if available. Briefly describe each present cue and its likely polarity. (2) Synthesize a Propositional Attitude Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis about the speaker’s evaluative stance toward what is being talked about. If the cues converge, state that they reinforce the same polarity. If some cues diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in the observable evidence without speculating beyond it.

Complete the opinion sentiment analysis task as follows: (1) Decode Propositional & Affective Signals (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically decode the spoken/ textual content to identify opinionated predicates, evaluative terms, intensifiers/negations, and modality markers (lexical content/transcript if provided). Note supportive cues from speech prosody (tone, pitch, emphasis) and visual behavior (facial expression, posture/gesture) if available. Briefly describe each present cue and its likely polarity. (2) Synthesize a Propositional Attitude Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis about the speaker’s evaluative stance toward what is being talked about. If the cues converge, state that they reinforce the same polarity. If some cues diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in the observable evidence without speculating beyond it.

(2) Synthesize a Propositional Attitude Hypothesis (Cognitive Empathy): Integrate the decoded cues into a coherent here-and-now hypothesis about the speaker’s evaluative stance toward what is being talked about. If the cues converge, state that they reinforce the same polarity. If some cues diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in the observable evidence without speculating beyond it. (3) Attribute from the Speaker’s Perspective (Perspective-Taking): Refine the hypothesis to attribute the single most plausible immediate overall polarity from the speaker’s perspective (not the viewer’s reaction and not a stable trait). (4) Conclude and Map to Label: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then choose exactly one label from: neutral, negative, positive, and output exactly {'emotion': 'label'}."

Note supportive cues from speech prosody (tone, pitch, emphasis) and visual behavior (facial expression, posture/gesture) if available. Briefly describe each present cue and its likely polarity.

If the cues converge, state that they reinforce the same polarity. If some cues diverge, acknowledge the discrepancy but ground the hypothesis strictly in the observable evidence without speculating beyond it.
