The atmosphere in the studio was calming, which really helped me focus.\n[1] Priya: Maya, I agree about Hatha Yoga! The breathing technique is essential and actually feels very grounding to me because it slows down my racing thoughts.\n[2] Anya: For me, the physical poses in Hatha Yoga are challenging, but I think that's what makes the practice rewarding since it pushes my limits in a good way.\n[3] Ken: I like how the instructor’s instructions are always clear—her voice is so soothing in the audio guide that it helps me stay relaxed throughout.\n[4] Justin: You all are so experienced! I’ve noticed the community in the Hatha Yoga class is incredibly supportive, which creates a friendly environment for beginners.\n[5] Liam: To be honest, since I started Hatha Yoga, my flexibility has improved—I can now touch my toes easily, as you can see in this video.\nYou are a multimodal affective computing expert grounded in theory of mind. Model each utterance/post as a communicative act from a specific holder toward targets in context. Follow a relational and contextual reasoning chain: first infer evaluative states from textual cues (cues → state), then bind each state to a concrete target and aspect within the discourse or scene (state → about(entity, context)) and express it as structured quintuples. (1) Decode Propositional & Referencing Cues (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically parse textual content for affective/evaluative markers—opinion predicates, polarity words, intensifiers/negations, hedges/modality—and resolve speaker identity (holder). Perform basic coreference/alias resolution to link pronouns or aliases to explicit targets. Keep strictly to the given text; do not import external facts. (2) Attribute Target-Level Attitudes (Cognitive Empathy, First-Order): For each holder, infer the here-and-now evaluative state toward a specific target and aspect indicated or implied by the text. If cues diverge (e.g., positive term with negative intensifier), acknowledge and ground the inference in the most coherent observable reading. If stance is weak/uncertain, treat sentiment as neutral. (3) Relational Mapping to Structured Quintuples (Perspective-Taking & Context Binding): Compose quintuples of the form (holder, target, aspect, opinion, sentiment). holder: the speaking author of the utterance; target: the entity being evaluated (brand/place/person/item/topic); aspect: the facet/property of the target (explicit noun phrase; allow implicit facet only if clearly signaled); opinion: the minimal surface phrase expressing the evaluation; sentiment: one of {positive, neutral, negative}, consistent with cues. Create separate quintuples for different targets/aspects; (4) Conclude and Output: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then output a single Python-style list of quintuples using single quotes and no extra commentary, e.g.: [('holder','target','aspect','opinion','sentiment'), ...]."

Model each utterance/post as a communicative act from a specific holder toward targets in context. Follow a relational and contextual reasoning chain: first infer evaluative states from textual cues (cues → state), then bind each state to a concrete target and aspect within the discourse or scene (state → about(entity, context)) and express it as structured quintuples. (1) Decode Propositional & Referencing Cues (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically parse textual content for affective/evaluative markers—opinion predicates, polarity words, intensifiers/negations, hedges/modality—and resolve speaker identity (holder). Perform basic coreference/alias resolution to link pronouns or aliases to explicit targets. Keep strictly to the given text; do not import external facts. (2) Attribute Target-Level Attitudes (Cognitive Empathy, First-Order): For each holder, infer the here-and-now evaluative state toward a specific target and aspect indicated or implied by the text. If cues diverge (e.g., positive term with negative intensifier), acknowledge and ground the inference in the most coherent observable reading. If stance is weak/uncertain, treat sentiment as neutral. (3) Relational Mapping to Structured Quintuples (Perspective-Taking & Context Binding): Compose quintuples of the form (holder, target, aspect, opinion, sentiment). holder: the speaking author of the utterance; target: the entity being evaluated (brand/place/person/item/topic); aspect: the facet/property of the target (explicit noun phrase; allow implicit facet only if clearly signaled); opinion: the minimal surface phrase expressing the evaluation; sentiment: one of {positive, neutral, negative}, consistent with cues. Create separate quintuples for different targets/aspects; (4) Conclude and Output: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then output a single Python-style list of quintuples using single quotes and no extra commentary, e.g.: [('holder','target','aspect','opinion','sentiment'), ...]."

(2) Attribute Target-Level Attitudes (Cognitive Empathy, First-Order): For each holder, infer the here-and-now evaluative state toward a specific target and aspect indicated or implied by the text. If cues diverge (e.g., positive term with negative intensifier), acknowledge and ground the inference in the most coherent observable reading. If stance is weak/uncertain, treat sentiment as neutral. (3) Relational Mapping to Structured Quintuples (Perspective-Taking & Context Binding): Compose quintuples of the form (holder, target, aspect, opinion, sentiment). holder: the speaking author of the utterance; target: the entity being evaluated (brand/place/person/item/topic); aspect: the facet/property of the target (explicit noun phrase; allow implicit facet only if clearly signaled); opinion: the minimal surface phrase expressing the evaluation; sentiment: one of {positive, neutral, negative}, consistent with cues. Create separate quintuples for different targets/aspects; (4) Conclude and Output: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then output a single Python-style list of quintuples using single quotes and no extra commentary, e.g.: [('holder','target','aspect','opinion','sentiment'), ...]."

Model each utterance/post as a communicative act from a specific holder toward targets in context. Follow a relational and contextual reasoning chain: first infer evaluative states from textual cues (cues → state), then bind each state to a concrete target and aspect within the discourse or scene (state → about(entity, context)) and express it as structured quintuples. (1) Decode Propositional & Referencing Cues (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically parse textual content for affective/evaluative markers—opinion predicates, polarity words, intensifiers/negations, hedges/modality—and resolve speaker identity (holder). Perform basic coreference/alias resolution to link pronouns or aliases to explicit targets. Keep strictly to the given text; do not import external facts. (2) Attribute Target-Level Attitudes (Cognitive Empathy, First-Order): For each holder, infer the here-and-now evaluative state toward a specific target and aspect indicated or implied by the text. If cues diverge (e.g., positive term with negative intensifier), acknowledge and ground the inference in the most coherent observable reading. If stance is weak/uncertain, treat sentiment as neutral. (3) Relational Mapping to Structured Quintuples (Perspective-Taking & Context Binding): Compose quintuples of the form (holder, target, aspect, opinion, sentiment). holder: the speaking author of the utterance; target: the entity being evaluated (brand/place/person/item/topic); aspect: the facet/property of the target (explicit noun phrase; allow implicit facet only if clearly signaled); opinion: the minimal surface phrase expressing the evaluation; sentiment: one of {positive, neutral, negative}, consistent with cues. Create separate quintuples for different targets/aspects; (4) Conclude and Output: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then output a single Python-style list of quintuples using single quotes and no extra commentary, e.g.: [('holder','target','aspect','opinion','sentiment'), ...]."

(2) Attribute Target-Level Attitudes (Cognitive Empathy, First-Order): For each holder, infer the here-and-now evaluative state toward a specific target and aspect indicated or implied by the text. If cues diverge (e.g., positive term with negative intensifier), acknowledge and ground the inference in the most coherent observable reading. If stance is weak/uncertain, treat sentiment as neutral. (3) Relational Mapping to Structured Quintuples (Perspective-Taking & Context Binding): Compose quintuples of the form (holder, target, aspect, opinion, sentiment). holder: the speaking author of the utterance; target: the entity being evaluated (brand/place/person/item/topic); aspect: the facet/property of the target (explicit noun phrase; allow implicit facet only if clearly signaled); opinion: the minimal surface phrase expressing the evaluation; sentiment: one of {positive, neutral, negative}, consistent with cues. Create separate quintuples for different targets/aspects; (4) Conclude and Output: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then output a single Python-style list of quintuples using single quotes and no extra commentary, e.g.: [('holder','target','aspect','opinion','sentiment'), ...]."

Model each utterance/post as a communicative act from a specific holder toward targets in context. Follow a relational and contextual reasoning chain: first infer evaluative states from textual cues (cues → state), then bind each state to a concrete target and aspect within the discourse or scene (state → about(entity, context)) and express it as structured quintuples. (1) Decode Propositional & Referencing Cues (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically parse textual content for affective/evaluative markers—opinion predicates, polarity words, intensifiers/negations, hedges/modality—and resolve speaker identity (holder). Perform basic coreference/alias resolution to link pronouns or aliases to explicit targets. Keep strictly to the given text; do not import external facts. (2) Attribute Target-Level Attitudes (Cognitive Empathy, First-Order): For each holder, infer the here-and-now evaluative state toward a specific target and aspect indicated or implied by the text. If cues diverge (e.g., positive term with negative intensifier), acknowledge and ground the inference in the most coherent observable reading. If stance is weak/uncertain, treat sentiment as neutral.

I find highly liquid assets advantageous since they allow for quick access to funds in emergencies.\n[3] Lila: Jorge, that's true, but I’d say the clarity of goals is the decisive factor in choosing an investment strategy. Without clear objectives, it’s difficult to select the right combination of risk, diversification, and liquidity for your needs.\n[4] Samira: I’d like to add that fees play a major role in investment strategies too.

(3) Relational Mapping to Structured Quintuples (Perspective-Taking & Context Binding): Compose quintuples of the form (holder, target, aspect, opinion, sentiment). holder: the speaking author of the utterance; target: the entity being evaluated (brand/place/person/item/topic); aspect: the facet/property of the target (explicit noun phrase; allow implicit facet only if clearly signaled); opinion: the minimal surface phrase expressing the evaluation; sentiment: one of {positive, neutral, negative}, consistent with cues. Create separate quintuples for different targets/aspects; (4) Conclude and Output: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then output a single Python-style list of quintuples using single quotes and no extra commentary, e.g.: [('holder','target','aspect','opinion','sentiment'), ...]."

Follow a relational and contextual reasoning chain: first infer evaluative states from textual cues (cues → state), then bind each state to a concrete target and aspect within the discourse or scene (state → about(entity, context)) and express it as structured quintuples. (1) Decode Propositional & Referencing Cues (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically parse textual content for affective/evaluative markers—opinion predicates, polarity words, intensifiers/negations, hedges/modality—and resolve speaker identity (holder). Perform basic coreference/alias resolution to link pronouns or aliases to explicit targets. Keep strictly to the given text; do not import external facts. (2) Attribute Target-Level Attitudes (Cognitive Empathy, First-Order): For each holder, infer the here-and-now evaluative state toward a specific target and aspect indicated or implied by the text. If cues diverge (e.g., positive term with negative intensifier), acknowledge and ground the inference in the most coherent observable reading. If stance is weak/uncertain, treat sentiment as neutral. (3) Relational Mapping to Structured Quintuples (Perspective-Taking & Context Binding): Compose quintuples of the form (holder, target, aspect, opinion, sentiment). holder: the speaking author of the utterance; target: the entity being evaluated (brand/place/person/item/topic); aspect: the facet/property of the target (explicit noun phrase; allow implicit facet only if clearly signaled); opinion: the minimal surface phrase expressing the evaluation; sentiment: one of {positive, neutral, negative}, consistent with cues. Create separate quintuples for different targets/aspects; (4) Conclude and Output: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then output a single Python-style list of quintuples using single quotes and no extra commentary, e.g.: [('holder','target','aspect','opinion','sentiment'), ...]."

Model each utterance/post as a communicative act from a specific holder toward targets in context. Follow a relational and contextual reasoning chain: first infer evaluative states from textual cues (cues → state), then bind each state to a concrete target and aspect within the discourse or scene (state → about(entity, context)) and express it as structured quintuples. (1) Decode Propositional & Referencing Cues (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically parse textual content for affective/evaluative markers—opinion predicates, polarity words, intensifiers/negations, hedges/modality—and resolve speaker identity (holder). Perform basic coreference/alias resolution to link pronouns or aliases to explicit targets. Keep strictly to the given text; do not import external facts. (2) Attribute Target-Level Attitudes (Cognitive Empathy, First-Order): For each holder, infer the here-and-now evaluative state toward a specific target and aspect indicated or implied by the text. If cues diverge (e.g., positive term with negative intensifier), acknowledge and ground the inference in the most coherent observable reading. If stance is weak/uncertain, treat sentiment as neutral. (3) Relational Mapping to Structured Quintuples (Perspective-Taking & Context Binding): Compose quintuples of the form (holder, target, aspect, opinion, sentiment). holder: the speaking author of the utterance; target: the entity being evaluated (brand/place/person/item/topic); aspect: the facet/property of the target (explicit noun phrase; allow implicit facet only if clearly signaled); opinion: the minimal surface phrase expressing the evaluation; sentiment: one of {positive, neutral, negative}, consistent with cues. Create separate quintuples for different targets/aspects; (4) Conclude and Output: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then output a single Python-style list of quintuples using single quotes and no extra commentary, e.g.: [('holder','target','aspect','opinion','sentiment'), ...]."

Follow a relational and contextual reasoning chain: first infer evaluative states from textual cues (cues → state), then bind each state to a concrete target and aspect within the discourse or scene (state → about(entity, context)) and express it as structured quintuples. (1) Decode Propositional & Referencing Cues (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically parse textual content for affective/evaluative markers—opinion predicates, polarity words, intensifiers/negations, hedges/modality—and resolve speaker identity (holder). Perform basic coreference/alias resolution to link pronouns or aliases to explicit targets. Keep strictly to the given text; do not import external facts. (2) Attribute Target-Level Attitudes (Cognitive Empathy, First-Order): For each holder, infer the here-and-now evaluative state toward a specific target and aspect indicated or implied by the text. If cues diverge (e.g., positive term with negative intensifier), acknowledge and ground the inference in the most coherent observable reading. If stance is weak/uncertain, treat sentiment as neutral. (3) Relational Mapping to Structured Quintuples (Perspective-Taking & Context Binding): Compose quintuples of the form (holder, target, aspect, opinion, sentiment). holder: the speaking author of the utterance; target: the entity being evaluated (brand/place/person/item/topic); aspect: the facet/property of the target (explicit noun phrase; allow implicit facet only if clearly signaled); opinion: the minimal surface phrase expressing the evaluation; sentiment: one of {positive, neutral, negative}, consistent with cues. Create separate quintuples for different targets/aspects; (4) Conclude and Output: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then output a single Python-style list of quintuples using single quotes and no extra commentary, e.g.: [('holder','target','aspect','opinion','sentiment'), ...]."

Model each utterance/post as a communicative act from a specific holder toward targets in context. Follow a relational and contextual reasoning chain: first infer evaluative states from textual cues (cues → state), then bind each state to a concrete target and aspect within the discourse or scene (state → about(entity, context)) and express it as structured quintuples. (1) Decode Propositional & Referencing Cues (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically parse textual content for affective/evaluative markers—opinion predicates, polarity words, intensifiers/negations, hedges/modality—and resolve speaker identity (holder). Perform basic coreference/alias resolution to link pronouns or aliases to explicit targets. Keep strictly to the given text; do not import external facts. (2) Attribute Target-Level Attitudes (Cognitive Empathy, First-Order): For each holder, infer the here-and-now evaluative state toward a specific target and aspect indicated or implied by the text. If cues diverge (e.g., positive term with negative intensifier), acknowledge and ground the inference in the most coherent observable reading. If stance is weak/uncertain, treat sentiment as neutral. (3) Relational Mapping to Structured Quintuples (Perspective-Taking & Context Binding): Compose quintuples of the form (holder, target, aspect, opinion, sentiment). holder: the speaking author of the utterance; target: the entity being evaluated (brand/place/person/item/topic); aspect: the facet/property of the target (explicit noun phrase; allow implicit facet only if clearly signaled); opinion: the minimal surface phrase expressing the evaluation; sentiment: one of {positive, neutral, negative}, consistent with cues. Create separate quintuples for different targets/aspects; (4) Conclude and Output: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then output a single Python-style list of quintuples using single quotes and no extra commentary, e.g.: [('holder','target','aspect','opinion','sentiment'), ...]."

If cues diverge (e.g., positive term with negative intensifier), acknowledge and ground the inference in the most coherent observable reading. If stance is weak/uncertain, treat sentiment as neutral. (3) Relational Mapping to Structured Quintuples (Perspective-Taking & Context Binding): Compose quintuples of the form (holder, target, aspect, opinion, sentiment). holder: the speaking author of the utterance; target: the entity being evaluated (brand/place/person/item/topic); aspect: the facet/property of the target (explicit noun phrase; allow implicit facet only if clearly signaled); opinion: the minimal surface phrase expressing the evaluation; sentiment: one of {positive, neutral, negative}, consistent with cues. Create separate quintuples for different targets/aspects; (4) Conclude and Output: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then output a single Python-style list of quintuples using single quotes and no extra commentary, e.g.: [('holder','target','aspect','opinion','sentiment'), ...]."

Model each utterance/post as a communicative act from a specific holder toward targets in context. Follow a relational and contextual reasoning chain: first infer evaluative states from textual cues (cues → state), then bind each state to a concrete target and aspect within the discourse or scene (state → about(entity, context)) and express it as structured quintuples. (1) Decode Propositional & Referencing Cues (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically parse textual content for affective/evaluative markers—opinion predicates, polarity words, intensifiers/negations, hedges/modality—and resolve speaker identity (holder). Perform basic coreference/alias resolution to link pronouns or aliases to explicit targets. Keep strictly to the given text; do not import external facts. (2) Attribute Target-Level Attitudes (Cognitive Empathy, First-Order): For each holder, infer the here-and-now evaluative state toward a specific target and aspect indicated or implied by the text. If cues diverge (e.g., positive term with negative intensifier), acknowledge and ground the inference in the most coherent observable reading. If stance is weak/uncertain, treat sentiment as neutral.

Create separate quintuples for different targets/aspects; (4) Conclude and Output: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then output a single Python-style list of quintuples using single quotes and no extra commentary, e.g.: [('holder','target','aspect','opinion','sentiment'), ...]."

(2) Attribute Target-Level Attitudes (Cognitive Empathy, First-Order): For each holder, infer the here-and-now evaluative state toward a specific target and aspect indicated or implied by the text. If cues diverge (e.g., positive term with negative intensifier), acknowledge and ground the inference in the most coherent observable reading. If stance is weak/uncertain, treat sentiment as neutral. (3) Relational Mapping to Structured Quintuples (Perspective-Taking & Context Binding): Compose quintuples of the form (holder, target, aspect, opinion, sentiment). holder: the speaking author of the utterance; target: the entity being evaluated (brand/place/person/item/topic); aspect: the facet/property of the target (explicit noun phrase; allow implicit facet only if clearly signaled); opinion: the minimal surface phrase expressing the evaluation; sentiment: one of {positive, neutral, negative}, consistent with cues. Create separate quintuples for different targets/aspects; (4) Conclude and Output: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then output a single Python-style list of quintuples using single quotes and no extra commentary, e.g.: [('holder','target','aspect','opinion','sentiment'), ...]."

Model each utterance/post as a communicative act from a specific holder toward targets in context. Follow a relational and contextual reasoning chain: first infer evaluative states from textual cues (cues → state), then bind each state to a concrete target and aspect within the discourse or scene (state → about(entity, context)) and express it as structured quintuples. (1) Decode Propositional & Referencing Cues (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically parse textual content for affective/evaluative markers—opinion predicates, polarity words, intensifiers/negations, hedges/modality—and resolve speaker identity (holder). Perform basic coreference/alias resolution to link pronouns or aliases to explicit targets. Keep strictly to the given text; do not import external facts. (2) Attribute Target-Level Attitudes (Cognitive Empathy, First-Order): For each holder, infer the here-and-now evaluative state toward a specific target and aspect indicated or implied by the text. If cues diverge (e.g., positive term with negative intensifier), acknowledge and ground the inference in the most coherent observable reading. If stance is weak/uncertain, treat sentiment as neutral. (3) Relational Mapping to Structured Quintuples (Perspective-Taking & Context Binding): Compose quintuples of the form (holder, target, aspect, opinion, sentiment). holder: the speaking author of the utterance; target: the entity being evaluated (brand/place/person/item/topic); aspect: the facet/property of the target (explicit noun phrase; allow implicit facet only if clearly signaled); opinion: the minimal surface phrase expressing the evaluation; sentiment: one of {positive, neutral, negative}, consistent with cues. Create separate quintuples for different targets/aspects; (4) Conclude and Output: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then output a single Python-style list of quintuples using single quotes and no extra commentary, e.g.: [('holder','target','aspect','opinion','sentiment'), ...]."

Model each utterance/post as a communicative act from a specific holder toward targets in context. Follow a relational and contextual reasoning chain: first infer evaluative states from textual cues (cues → state), then bind each state to a concrete target and aspect within the discourse or scene (state → about(entity, context)) and express it as structured quintuples. (1) Decode Propositional & Referencing Cues (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically parse textual content for affective/evaluative markers—opinion predicates, polarity words, intensifiers/negations, hedges/modality—and resolve speaker identity (holder). Perform basic coreference/alias resolution to link pronouns or aliases to explicit targets. Keep strictly to the given text; do not import external facts. (2) Attribute Target-Level Attitudes (Cognitive Empathy, First-Order): For each holder, infer the here-and-now evaluative state toward a specific target and aspect indicated or implied by the text. If cues diverge (e.g., positive term with negative intensifier), acknowledge and ground the inference in the most coherent observable reading. If stance is weak/uncertain, treat sentiment as neutral. (3) Relational Mapping to Structured Quintuples (Perspective-Taking & Context Binding): Compose quintuples of the form (holder, target, aspect, opinion, sentiment). holder: the speaking author of the utterance; target: the entity being evaluated (brand/place/person/item/topic); aspect: the facet/property of the target (explicit noun phrase; allow implicit facet only if clearly signaled); opinion: the minimal surface phrase expressing the evaluation; sentiment: one of {positive, neutral, negative}, consistent with cues.

(2) Attribute Target-Level Attitudes (Cognitive Empathy, First-Order): For each holder, infer the here-and-now evaluative state toward a specific target and aspect indicated or implied by the text. If cues diverge (e.g., positive term with negative intensifier), acknowledge and ground the inference in the most coherent observable reading. If stance is weak/uncertain, treat sentiment as neutral. (3) Relational Mapping to Structured Quintuples (Perspective-Taking & Context Binding): Compose quintuples of the form (holder, target, aspect, opinion, sentiment). holder: the speaking author of the utterance; target: the entity being evaluated (brand/place/person/item/topic); aspect: the facet/property of the target (explicit noun phrase; allow implicit facet only if clearly signaled); opinion: the minimal surface phrase expressing the evaluation; sentiment: one of {positive, neutral, negative}, consistent with cues. Create separate quintuples for different targets/aspects; (4) Conclude and Output: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then output a single Python-style list of quintuples using single quotes and no extra commentary, e.g.: [('holder','target','aspect','opinion','sentiment'), ...]."

Follow a relational and contextual reasoning chain: first infer evaluative states from textual cues (cues → state), then bind each state to a concrete target and aspect within the discourse or scene (state → about(entity, context)) and express it as structured quintuples. (1) Decode Propositional & Referencing Cues (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically parse textual content for affective/evaluative markers—opinion predicates, polarity words, intensifiers/negations, hedges/modality—and resolve speaker identity (holder). Perform basic coreference/alias resolution to link pronouns or aliases to explicit targets. Keep strictly to the given text; do not import external facts. (2) Attribute Target-Level Attitudes (Cognitive Empathy, First-Order): For each holder, infer the here-and-now evaluative state toward a specific target and aspect indicated or implied by the text. If cues diverge (e.g., positive term with negative intensifier), acknowledge and ground the inference in the most coherent observable reading. If stance is weak/uncertain, treat sentiment as neutral. (3) Relational Mapping to Structured Quintuples (Perspective-Taking & Context Binding): Compose quintuples of the form (holder, target, aspect, opinion, sentiment). holder: the speaking author of the utterance; target: the entity being evaluated (brand/place/person/item/topic); aspect: the facet/property of the target (explicit noun phrase; allow implicit facet only if clearly signaled); opinion: the minimal surface phrase expressing the evaluation; sentiment: one of {positive, neutral, negative}, consistent with cues. Create separate quintuples for different targets/aspects; (4) Conclude and Output: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then output a single Python-style list of quintuples using single quotes and no extra commentary, e.g.: [('holder','target','aspect','opinion','sentiment'), ...]."

Perform basic coreference/alias resolution to link pronouns or aliases to explicit targets. Keep strictly to the given text; do not import external facts. (2) Attribute Target-Level Attitudes (Cognitive Empathy, First-Order): For each holder, infer the here-and-now evaluative state toward a specific target and aspect indicated or implied by the text. If cues diverge (e.g., positive term with negative intensifier), acknowledge and ground the inference in the most coherent observable reading. If stance is weak/uncertain, treat sentiment as neutral. (3) Relational Mapping to Structured Quintuples (Perspective-Taking & Context Binding): Compose quintuples of the form (holder, target, aspect, opinion, sentiment). holder: the speaking author of the utterance; target: the entity being evaluated (brand/place/person/item/topic); aspect: the facet/property of the target (explicit noun phrase; allow implicit facet only if clearly signaled); opinion: the minimal surface phrase expressing the evaluation; sentiment: one of {positive, neutral, negative}, consistent with cues. Create separate quintuples for different targets/aspects; (4) Conclude and Output: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then output a single Python-style list of quintuples using single quotes and no extra commentary, e.g.: [('holder','target','aspect','opinion','sentiment'), ...]."

(1) Decode Propositional & Referencing Cues (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically parse textual content for affective/evaluative markers—opinion predicates, polarity words, intensifiers/negations, hedges/modality—and resolve speaker identity (holder).

Model each utterance/post as a communicative act from a specific holder toward targets in context. Follow a relational and contextual reasoning chain: first infer evaluative states from textual cues (cues → state), then bind each state to a concrete target and aspect within the discourse or scene (state → about(entity, context)) and express it as structured quintuples. (1) Decode Propositional & Referencing Cues (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically parse textual content for affective/evaluative markers—opinion predicates, polarity words, intensifiers/negations, hedges/modality—and resolve speaker identity (holder). Perform basic coreference/alias resolution to link pronouns or aliases to explicit targets. Keep strictly to the given text; do not import external facts. (2) Attribute Target-Level Attitudes (Cognitive Empathy, First-Order): For each holder, infer the here-and-now evaluative state toward a specific target and aspect indicated or implied by the text. If cues diverge (e.g., positive term with negative intensifier), acknowledge and ground the inference in the most coherent observable reading. If stance is weak/uncertain, treat sentiment as neutral. (3) Relational Mapping to Structured Quintuples (Perspective-Taking & Context Binding): Compose quintuples of the form (holder, target, aspect, opinion, sentiment). holder: the speaking author of the utterance; target: the entity being evaluated (brand/place/person/item/topic); aspect: the facet/property of the target (explicit noun phrase; allow implicit facet only if clearly signaled); opinion: the minimal surface phrase expressing the evaluation; sentiment: one of {positive, neutral, negative}, consistent with cues. Create separate quintuples for different targets/aspects; (4) Conclude and Output: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then output a single Python-style list of quintuples using single quotes and no extra commentary, e.g.: [('holder','target','aspect','opinion','sentiment'), ...]."

I usually skip it because it feels heavy, especially in the morning.\n[3] Jon: I've found that overnight oats with Greek yogurt are quite delightful—the thickness actually helps the oats absorb more flavor.\n[4] Priya: Avocado toast is another health-conscious favorite.

Model each utterance/post as a communicative act from a specific holder toward targets in context. Follow a relational and contextual reasoning chain: first infer evaluative states from textual cues (cues → state), then bind each state to a concrete target and aspect within the discourse or scene (state → about(entity, context)) and express it as structured quintuples. (1) Decode Propositional & Referencing Cues (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically parse textual content for affective/evaluative markers—opinion predicates, polarity words, intensifiers/negations, hedges/modality—and resolve speaker identity (holder). Perform basic coreference/alias resolution to link pronouns or aliases to explicit targets. Keep strictly to the given text; do not import external facts. (2) Attribute Target-Level Attitudes (Cognitive Empathy, First-Order): For each holder, infer the here-and-now evaluative state toward a specific target and aspect indicated or implied by the text. If cues diverge (e.g., positive term with negative intensifier), acknowledge and ground the inference in the most coherent observable reading. If stance is weak/uncertain, treat sentiment as neutral. (3) Relational Mapping to Structured Quintuples (Perspective-Taking & Context Binding): Compose quintuples of the form (holder, target, aspect, opinion, sentiment). holder: the speaking author of the utterance; target: the entity being evaluated (brand/place/person/item/topic); aspect: the facet/property of the target (explicit noun phrase; allow implicit facet only if clearly signaled); opinion: the minimal surface phrase expressing the evaluation; sentiment: one of {positive, neutral, negative}, consistent with cues. Create separate quintuples for different targets/aspects; (4) Conclude and Output: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then output a single Python-style list of quintuples using single quotes and no extra commentary, e.g.: [('holder','target','aspect','opinion','sentiment'), ...]."

Model each utterance/post as a communicative act from a specific holder toward targets in context. Follow a relational and contextual reasoning chain: first infer evaluative states from textual cues (cues → state), then bind each state to a concrete target and aspect within the discourse or scene (state → about(entity, context)) and express it as structured quintuples. (1) Decode Propositional & Referencing Cues (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically parse textual content for affective/evaluative markers—opinion predicates, polarity words, intensifiers/negations, hedges/modality—and resolve speaker identity (holder). Perform basic coreference/alias resolution to link pronouns or aliases to explicit targets. Keep strictly to the given text; do not import external facts. (2) Attribute Target-Level Attitudes (Cognitive Empathy, First-Order): For each holder, infer the here-and-now evaluative state toward a specific target and aspect indicated or implied by the text. If cues diverge (e.g., positive term with negative intensifier), acknowledge and ground the inference in the most coherent observable reading. If stance is weak/uncertain, treat sentiment as neutral. (3) Relational Mapping to Structured Quintuples (Perspective-Taking & Context Binding): Compose quintuples of the form (holder, target, aspect, opinion, sentiment). holder: the speaking author of the utterance; target: the entity being evaluated (brand/place/person/item/topic); aspect: the facet/property of the target (explicit noun phrase; allow implicit facet only if clearly signaled); opinion: the minimal surface phrase expressing the evaluation; sentiment: one of {positive, neutral, negative}, consistent with cues. Create separate quintuples for different targets/aspects; (4) Conclude and Output: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then output a single Python-style list of quintuples using single quotes and no extra commentary, e.g.: [('holder','target','aspect','opinion','sentiment'), ...]."

I think their texture is often too chewy, making the whole experience a bit disappointing for me.\n[2] Isabella: Actually, Marcel, I recently saw a feature on a French patisserie that uses almond flour to create a lighter texture in their macarons.

Model each utterance/post as a communicative act from a specific holder toward targets in context. Follow a relational and contextual reasoning chain: first infer evaluative states from textual cues (cues → state), then bind each state to a concrete target and aspect within the discourse or scene (state → about(entity, context)) and express it as structured quintuples. (1) Decode Propositional & Referencing Cues (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically parse textual content for affective/evaluative markers—opinion predicates, polarity words, intensifiers/negations, hedges/modality—and resolve speaker identity (holder). Perform basic coreference/alias resolution to link pronouns or aliases to explicit targets. Keep strictly to the given text; do not import external facts. (2) Attribute Target-Level Attitudes (Cognitive Empathy, First-Order): For each holder, infer the here-and-now evaluative state toward a specific target and aspect indicated or implied by the text. If cues diverge (e.g., positive term with negative intensifier), acknowledge and ground the inference in the most coherent observable reading. If stance is weak/uncertain, treat sentiment as neutral.

Follow a relational and contextual reasoning chain: first infer evaluative states from textual cues (cues → state), then bind each state to a concrete target and aspect within the discourse or scene (state → about(entity, context)) and express it as structured quintuples. (1) Decode Propositional & Referencing Cues (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically parse textual content for affective/evaluative markers—opinion predicates, polarity words, intensifiers/negations, hedges/modality—and resolve speaker identity (holder). Perform basic coreference/alias resolution to link pronouns or aliases to explicit targets. Keep strictly to the given text; do not import external facts. (2) Attribute Target-Level Attitudes (Cognitive Empathy, First-Order): For each holder, infer the here-and-now evaluative state toward a specific target and aspect indicated or implied by the text. If cues diverge (e.g., positive term with negative intensifier), acknowledge and ground the inference in the most coherent observable reading. If stance is weak/uncertain, treat sentiment as neutral.

Follow a relational and contextual reasoning chain: first infer evaluative states from textual cues (cues → state), then bind each state to a concrete target and aspect within the discourse or scene (state → about(entity, context)) and express it as structured quintuples. (1) Decode Propositional & Referencing Cues (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically parse textual content for affective/evaluative markers—opinion predicates, polarity words, intensifiers/negations, hedges/modality—and resolve speaker identity (holder). Perform basic coreference/alias resolution to link pronouns or aliases to explicit targets. Keep strictly to the given text; do not import external facts. (2) Attribute Target-Level Attitudes (Cognitive Empathy, First-Order): For each holder, infer the here-and-now evaluative state toward a specific target and aspect indicated or implied by the text.

The absorption rate of different magnesium forms is a crucial aspect, and switching from magnesium oxide to magnesium glycinate made my sleep much deeper.\n[2] Elena: I think sleep architecture is most positively impacted by supplements containing both magnesium and glycine.

I find the safety profile of melatonin as a supplement pretty reassuring, since in this video they show studies on long-term use with minimal adverse effects in adults.\n[4] Matteo: Actually, I believe the melatonin dosage in most supplements is excessive, and that can sometimes disrupt the body’s natural circadian rhythm—so I’m less optimistic about its widespread use now that Jonas mentioned side effects.\n[5] Priya: Jonas and Elena, you make solid points.

Model each utterance/post as a communicative act from a specific holder toward targets in context. Follow a relational and contextual reasoning chain: first infer evaluative states from textual cues (cues → state), then bind each state to a concrete target and aspect within the discourse or scene (state → about(entity, context)) and express it as structured quintuples. (1) Decode Propositional & Referencing Cues (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically parse textual content for affective/evaluative markers—opinion predicates, polarity words, intensifiers/negations, hedges/modality—and resolve speaker identity (holder). Perform basic coreference/alias resolution to link pronouns or aliases to explicit targets. Keep strictly to the given text; do not import external facts. (2) Attribute Target-Level Attitudes (Cognitive Empathy, First-Order): For each holder, infer the here-and-now evaluative state toward a specific target and aspect indicated or implied by the text. If cues diverge (e.g., positive term with negative intensifier), acknowledge and ground the inference in the most coherent observable reading. If stance is weak/uncertain, treat sentiment as neutral. (3) Relational Mapping to Structured Quintuples (Perspective-Taking & Context Binding): Compose quintuples of the form (holder, target, aspect, opinion, sentiment). holder: the speaking author of the utterance; target: the entity being evaluated (brand/place/person/item/topic); aspect: the facet/property of the target (explicit noun phrase; allow implicit facet only if clearly signaled); opinion: the minimal surface phrase expressing the evaluation; sentiment: one of {positive, neutral, negative}, consistent with cues. Create separate quintuples for different targets/aspects; (4) Conclude and Output: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then output a single Python-style list of quintuples using single quotes and no extra commentary, e.g.: [('holder','target','aspect','opinion','sentiment'), ...]."

Model each utterance/post as a communicative act from a specific holder toward targets in context. Follow a relational and contextual reasoning chain: first infer evaluative states from textual cues (cues → state), then bind each state to a concrete target and aspect within the discourse or scene (state → about(entity, context)) and express it as structured quintuples. (1) Decode Propositional & Referencing Cues (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically parse textual content for affective/evaluative markers—opinion predicates, polarity words, intensifiers/negations, hedges/modality—and resolve speaker identity (holder). Perform basic coreference/alias resolution to link pronouns or aliases to explicit targets. Keep strictly to the given text; do not import external facts. (2) Attribute Target-Level Attitudes (Cognitive Empathy, First-Order): For each holder, infer the here-and-now evaluative state toward a specific target and aspect indicated or implied by the text. If cues diverge (e.g., positive term with negative intensifier), acknowledge and ground the inference in the most coherent observable reading. If stance is weak/uncertain, treat sentiment as neutral. (3) Relational Mapping to Structured Quintuples (Perspective-Taking & Context Binding): Compose quintuples of the form (holder, target, aspect, opinion, sentiment). holder: the speaking author of the utterance; target: the entity being evaluated (brand/place/person/item/topic); aspect: the facet/property of the target (explicit noun phrase; allow implicit facet only if clearly signaled); opinion: the minimal surface phrase expressing the evaluation; sentiment: one of {positive, neutral, negative}, consistent with cues. Create separate quintuples for different targets/aspects; (4) Conclude and Output: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then output a single Python-style list of quintuples using single quotes and no extra commentary, e.g.: [('holder','target','aspect','opinion','sentiment'), ...]."

Model each utterance/post as a communicative act from a specific holder toward targets in context. Follow a relational and contextual reasoning chain: first infer evaluative states from textual cues (cues → state), then bind each state to a concrete target and aspect within the discourse or scene (state → about(entity, context)) and express it as structured quintuples. (1) Decode Propositional & Referencing Cues (Perceptual Simulation): Systematically parse textual content for affective/evaluative markers—opinion predicates, polarity words, intensifiers/negations, hedges/modality—and resolve speaker identity (holder). Perform basic coreference/alias resolution to link pronouns or aliases to explicit targets. Keep strictly to the given text; do not import external facts. (2) Attribute Target-Level Attitudes (Cognitive Empathy, First-Order): For each holder, infer the here-and-now evaluative state toward a specific target and aspect indicated or implied by the text. If cues diverge (e.g., positive term with negative intensifier), acknowledge and ground the inference in the most coherent observable reading. If stance is weak/uncertain, treat sentiment as neutral. (3) Relational Mapping to Structured Quintuples (Perspective-Taking & Context Binding): Compose quintuples of the form (holder, target, aspect, opinion, sentiment). holder: the speaking author of the utterance; target: the entity being evaluated (brand/place/person/item/topic); aspect: the facet/property of the target (explicit noun phrase; allow implicit facet only if clearly signaled); opinion: the minimal surface phrase expressing the evaluation; sentiment: one of {positive, neutral, negative}, consistent with cues. Create separate quintuples for different targets/aspects; (4) Conclude and Output: Provide your reasoning following the steps above, then output a single Python-style list of quintuples using single quotes and no extra commentary, e.g.: [('holder','target','aspect','opinion','sentiment'), ...]."
